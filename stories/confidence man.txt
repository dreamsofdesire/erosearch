Chapter 1
Posted: August 02, 2003 - 12:00:00 am

I was in the principal's office again, and getting yelled at. Here it was just the second month of my freshman year, and 14-year-old ass was getting pounded.

But in a very nice way. Our high school's pretty, 37-year-old principal, Ellen McCarthy, was nude on her huge desk, her lithe legs wrapped around my naked behind, her pretty ankles beating a rapid tattoo on my thrusting ninth-grade buns.

Her arms were tightly encircling my neck and shoulders, and her hot, middle-aged cunt was greedily swallowing the stabbing motions of my swollen teenage prick. My face was cloaked by the fragrant short-blond hair of her Meg Ryan-ish do.

"Fuck me harder!" she shouted into my right ear. "Fuck your hard boy-cock into your principal's hot pussy! Fuck me harder, you stiff-cocked wonderful bastard! Make me cum so hard, you terrible nasty wonderful young stud!"

I have to say that under these conditions I didn't really mind being called to the principal's office, even if it was the third time this week. And this was way after school, at 7 o'clock on a Thursday night! I guess poor Miss McCarthy just couldn't get enough of what I had.

And what, may you ask, would a skinny 14-year-old have to offer a lovely school administrator 23 years her junior? Why would she drop her panties, spread her legs and point her pretty toes to the ceiling for some geeky ninth-grader who was recently too afraid to even speak to girls, let alone bone the principal on her own desk?

Well, as the saying goes, thereby hangs a tale...

I never much liked my Uncle Mike; few members of our family. did. He was loud, he was pushy, and he drank too much. He stayed up all hours, ate all kinds of spicy and outrageous stuff, and never bothered to spare your feelings if there was some weak spot in your armor.

He was married and divorced four times; he lost many a job but always found a new one quickly, and often a better one. Nothing seemed to faze him -- no struggle or setback appeared to make an impact. If his wife left him or his boss fired him, he would merely reach for another cigarette or beer and go on with whatever story he was telling.

For all these reasons, Uncle Mike was both the subject of considerable criticism and disguised envy. He was not have been what you'd call a role model in the classic sense, but he was definitely -- in his own way -- "cool."

I never much speculated on what made my father's half-brother so blasé about life's ups and downs until the summer he came to live with us while his latest messy divorce was being resolved.

Mike was not what you'd call a handsome man; but like folks like Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable, he had a certain charisma, a presence that evoked a response in people, especially women. His other qualities eventually drove females off, but some elusive charm drew them in initially.

Wiry, dark-haired with an archaic pencil-thin mustache, Mike almost always had a cigarette or beer glass at his lips, but this one August day in the driveway on the side of the house he set them aside and started to talk to me.

"Jack," he said, as I was carrying a bag of trash from the kitchen to the cans on the side of the house. "How old are you now?"

"Fourteen," I said, a little surprised that he was even addressing me. Since I had no money to lend him or smokes or drinks to provide, why would be waste his time on me?

"Fourteen," he said, tapping a fingernail on his teeth as if he was trying to remember something. "Gonna be in high school in the fall."

"That's right. Brooksville High," I said.

"That's a big step, going into high school. A lot of big memories, a lot of important stuff happens in high school. Seems a shame to see you in such a sorry-ass condition to begin with," he said, not unkindly.

I turned red with anger and embarrassment. "Whe- well, what do you mean by that?" I finally replied, my face hot and my steam rising.

"Well, look at you," he said as he slouched on a chair outside the kitchen porch. "You walk around like you expect to be punched in the face any minute. I don't see any skirts comin' around sniffing after you, and if you've got any friends, I haven't seen 'em."

They say that the true sting in reproach is the element of truth in it. What was accurate was that I was not the boldest lad to be entering high school, and that my timidity was as obvious as if I had worn a bright red T-shirt with the word "Wimp" stenciled on it.

"Now, don't get all upset," he said. "I don't piss on a man unless I got a reason to. What it is is that I was just like you my summer of being 14, and something happened that changed my life. I figger that maybe it's only fair that I should pass it on to you, since I never had a son." A pause. "That I know of."

Fucking the principal on her desk was only a burden in the sense that it sometimes took a little off my fastball -- if you receive my meaning -- when I sodomized the head cheerleader.

Pretty, perky Jenny Kennedy, with the long honey-blonde hair that reached to the middle of her back drove to school every morning along the same route I took when I hoofed it. The first month of school saw her bright-blue Mustang convertible roar indifferently past me; now her car slid up silently alongside me and she hissed" "Get in!"

I would quickly dart into her front seat and instead of her driving to the school three blocks away, she would wheel the brand-new steel chariot to a nearby shopping center, pull in behind the stores in an area secluded by trees, bushes and storage bins and throw herself into my arms.

"Mmmmmm," she'd say after she broke a long, tongue-twisting kiss. "I did like you said and didn't wear any panties today. Are you ready to fuck my asshole again like you did yesterday?"

In a moment she was on her hands and knees, her sweet plaid cheerleader skirt flipped up and me mounted on her soft-rounded ass, my rigid phallus drilling urgently in and out of her happy shitter.

"God, feels so fuckin' good!" she grunted. "So fuckin' good to be fucked deep in my asshole! God, I never knew! Just keep slammin' that hard cock of yours up my sexy cheerleader ass! Fuck my asshole and shoot out all your hot cum deep in my ass! Make me leak your hot sperm all day long at school! Buttfuck me hard!"

I did my best, which meant that my thrusts soon brought the 17-year-old prom and homecoming queen to a shuddering anal orgasm, but also resulted in me hosing a thick, hot stream of sperm deep in her schoolgirl guts. Eventually I would pull out, panting. and she would moan in delight.

"God, that was good! Who would think the head cheerleader at Brooksville High would be a butt-slut for a freshman boy?" she said, her perfect tush still upraised and leaking semen.

"I love being your butt-slut, Jack," she said, turning her face to me, an imploring look coming over her pretty 12th-grade features. "Do you think you could fuck my ass one more time this morning? Please?"

As I say, what did I have that put me in this admittedly unlikely but enviable situation.

In a word: confidence. A self-confidence both very ordinary and very special, and provided by the guidance of my roguish Uncle Mike.

"C'mere, kid," he said motioning me over. "Let me tell you what you need to know. And listen carefully; I'm not gonna cast pearls before slime."

"Swine," I corrected him.

"Whatever," he said. "Life's not complicated, but there's a few things you gotta remember. First thing is this: everybody's as scared as you are. no matter how they look. Deep inside everybody's puttin' on a front. People admire and follow folks who look like they've got the world by the tail, if only 'cause people figure a little of that self-confidence might rub off on them.

"Second is this: Everybody puts up a front. Everybody's got secrets: secret ideas, secret weaknesses, secret lusts, secret shit. And usually, the thing they're most secret about is the thing that they complain the most about. Want to spot the closet drunks? Find out who preaches the most against demon rum. Want to find out who's the hottest bitch, the kind of girl who'd do it with a donkey in the mud for $5 and a bus pass? Look around for the most frigid bitch there is.

"Third thing is this: If you look like you know what you're doing; you can get away with almost anything. A smooth operator could talk himself into Queen Elizabeth's outhouse, or Fort Knox. Talking your way into a girl's buttery little panties is child's play, compared to that.

"Fourth and lastly -- for now -- is this: confidence -- complete, unwavering confidence in yourself -- is a better superpower than X-ray vision or shooting fireballs out of your hands. For one thing, it's more likely to get you laid."

I listened to all of it, nodding here and there. "Well, Uncle Mike, it sounds good, but just saying 'I'm confident' doesn't seem to be enough. How do you go from being, well, self-conscious and doubtful to being so sure of yourself?"

He gave me a sly smile, and reached under his chair. "Oh, you'll need a little hand," he said, raising a baseball bat he'd secreted there. "Believe me, this is going to hurt you a lot more than it's going to hurt me."

For an instant I wondered what the heck-- and -- then -- I...

Chapter 2
Posted: August 02, 2003 - 12:00:00 am

Some of us dreamed of having the sweet attentions of the homecoming queen or the cutest pompom girl. We were setting our sights too low, you know.

At every school there was at least one other girl -- seldom involved in much of anything -- who was so appealing, so downright enthralling -- that she seemed above the mundane and childish activities and traditions of high school.

Just such a girl was Carol Pitocki. Tall, beauty without peer, always dressing elegantly and moving regally, you never saw her at a football game or a dance. She was the kind of young woman who attracted the attention of teenagers when she was in fifth grade, and when in high school, dated college boys and older.

So, in some ways, the true measure of just how unlikely the improvement in my interpersonal situation was not in banging the principal on her desk, or sodomizing the head cheerleader in her convertible, but in cuddling with Carol Pitocki in front of a fireplace on a rainy afternoon.

She loved to talk about feelings, and the true nature of love, and what the future held. The lovely 16-year--old girl, a junior to my freshman, she loved to wear thick, cable sweaters and designer jeans and sip coffee which we chatted about the "meaning of life." I have to honestly say that it was as big a thrill to just sit there and feel her soft breath on my face as it was to hear Ellen McCarthy beg me to pound her middle-aged (but very tight and hot) cunt or feel Jenny Kennedy's supersnug anus strip its way up and down my rigid teenboy phallus.

Or at the other end of the social spectrum, perhaps true high school immortality might come from finding a diamond in the rough, in turning a neglected, lonely girl into someone sexy and uninhibited.

You may express curiosity, envy or doubt at my situation, as well you should. It seemed more impossible than leaping over tall buildings or running faster than the speed of sound. But there I was, gently moving a stray strand of lovely hair from Carol's model-pretty face while I listened intently to her discourse.

Earlier, I wrote about how my Uncle Mike had taken pity (disgust?) on me and decided to impart his crooked wisdom of life to me. Up to that moment, I wasn't sure I wanted to hear anything he had to say: with a string of divorces and firings, his life has been a decidedly mixed performance.

", but Jack, my boy," he would say, "the measure of a man isn't how far or fast he falls, but how well he bounces back." And he did have a point. Despite his many annoying qualities -- including a know-it-all look perpetually plastered on his face -- he did "bounce" well, from one wife to a prettier lady, from one good job to a better one.

So it was on the late summer day when he began his tutoring of myself, a lesson that began in a most unlikely way.

Uncle Mike stuck the cigarette back into his mouth, stood and grasped the baseball bat while I looked on with a little bit of concern.

"Always keep your eye on the ball. Nice level swing; make contact; follow through," he said, as he made a couple of slow, practice passes with the Louisville Slugger. I was more perplexed than ever. What was this about batting? I didn't understand. And then --

WHOMP! I felt a sharp, powerful blow to my stomach. It pushed up my diaphragm and all the air belched out of my lungs. The "wind knocked out of me," I staggered and fell over, crashing to the concrete driveway with a doubtlessly stunned look on my face.

Uncle Mike then crouched down and whispered rapidly into my ear. He said:

"Sorry about the surprise attack, but no gain without pain, eh? For the next minute or so as you gasp for breath, you're in a very suggestible state, just almost like you've been hypnotized. What I'm going to say will go right to your subconscious where it will do you the most good.

"Hear me well: You are better than all those clean-cut all-American bastards that lord it over you and your friends. You are strong. You are graceful, relaxed, cool under pressure and supremely confident. Every pitch you hit; every shot you take goes in. You are shockingly honest and candid, and as a result of the foregoing, you are completely, absolutely, irresistible to all girls and women.

"You dress nicely, but not too trendy; you look out for the little guy; you don't follow other people's rules unless they make sense to you; you are able to laugh at yourself and suppress the urge to be cruel to others. But first and foremost: confidence. You have it! Nothing and no one stands in your way save your own conscience."

Of course, at time, as I lay there choking for air and thrashing about, the words were just a blur of sounds. But the subconscious mind hears and remembers; it remembers everything.

Eventually, I was able to catch my breath and pull myself to my feet.

"What... happened?" I said thickly, my head still swimming.

"Oh, I was just showing you some batting techniques and you stepped right in front of one of my swings. Knocked the wind right out of you. But," he said, a twinkle in his eye, "I've confident that you'll be all right after this."

"Umhh," I replied, feeling not a little weird. "I think I'd better lie down."

"Do that," he said, and sat down in his chair, reaching for a beer. "Take a little nap. And when you wake up, you'll feel like a whole new man."

So I did. And I did.

Amanda Powell was not the prettiest girl at Brooksville High School. She had too many freckles, she was at least three or four years out of style and her hair never quite seemed to be in any recognizable hairdo. But she was smart and pleasant and often quite unhappy.

Except not at this particular moment I'm going to describe. What's happening in my happy memory is in a secluded little knoll of trees in the park a few blocks from my house. It's dusk and Amanda Powell, 14-year-old skinny virgin and innocent has buried her face in my crotch.

She had hungrily ripped open my jeans and yanked down my shorts. Seeing my half-hard cock, she moaned a "Wow!" and popped the head into her mouth. With frisky enthusiasm, she began to bob her face up and down, and the predictable quickly followed; my cock hardened and lengthened and soon the combination of her active mouth and jacking hand had me approaching the moment of truth.

"Uh, Amanda, you're doing great," I managed to say, "but if you keep that up, I'm going to... "

She raised her face up, her lips wet with saliva and my own precum. "Cum? Cum in my mouth? God, Jack, what do you think I'm trying to do? I'm dying to taste your delicious cum! I love sucking your wonderful dick!"

And she did. As I lay there on the soft grass I felt her exceptionally talented mouth work its magic on my eager, happy boner, and it wasn't much longer before I felt my balls prickle, and then...

"Oh, God, Mandy, here it fuckin' cums!" I grunted, and then thick, long ropes of spunk started to shoot cannon-like out of my cock. The white stuff squirted forcefully into her mouth, which kept on sucking and slurping as I continued to unload my cream, jet after jet, pulse after pulse.

"Wow," I said, sweetly. "You are so good, Amanda. That was just the nicest." Her eyes were still upraised at me as she nursed at my prick. She popped her mouth off the head and grinned.

"Oh, I'm just getting started," she said. "I figure a 14-year-old boy has plenty more where that came from." And she resumed her sucking, and sure enough, my cock quickly returned to its steely state, and after another couple of minutes, I was again about to spout.

"Damn, Mandy," I cried as my second orgasm approached. "This is really so -- oh, God -- I feel like -- gonna OH GOD! OH, YES, SUCK IT UP YOU SEXY BITCH!" I arched my back and raised my butt off the grass and pushed my exploding cock deeply into her freckled face.

Now, by the time that plain Amanda and I had begun our "friendship," I had received many blow jobs from many girls and women. But to my delighted surprise, none of them seemed to be quite as talented and enthusiastic as this one. Something about the action of her long, pink tongue, I think, made her a natural, and this my second climax was stronger and longer than my first.

It felt like my balls were melting; my cock seemed to be ratcheted up another size in length and width, despite the wonderful cum I'd experienced just a few minutes before, it felt like this second eruption was bigger and creamier than the first.

After she'd gulped down the second steaming tribute from my adolescent balls, she leaned back on her haunches and smiled at me.

"So," she said, a little shyly. "Do you think I'm sexy?"

"Oh, jeez," I said, still breathing heavily from the luscious orgasm she just induced in me, "God, yes. You're about as sexy as they come." And I meant it. And I still do. Looking back, just the thought of her extraordinary blow jobs never fails to bring about a quick and bone-hard erection in me.

Amanda sighed. "You are so nice. All the other guys think I'm a dog. No, it's OK; I know it. Then you walked up to me and you were so friendly and funny I just knew that you were someone who could see more in me than just my frumpy old clothes and this goofy hairdo. My family doesn't believe in letting girls look too good; they think we'll get in trouble with boys."

Then she giggled. "I wonder what they'd say if they could see me now. On my knees in front of a half-naked guy with my tummy full of his hot sperm. And me just about to show him my tits."

The world is full of surprises; who knew that my casual kindness to Amanda would lead her to invite me to a walk in this shady park, and then to the oral delights that followed. And I lay there somewhat stunned when she unbuttoned the front of her JC Penny dress, shrugged it off her shoulders and then reached back about to unhook her plain, study bra.

I almost gasped. "My God, Amanda, they're just beautiful!" I said as her firm, creamy cones come into view. They were pretty lovely; good uplift, sweet pink nipples, round and juicy. You never would have known it, but underneath all that plain-Jane exterior was one if the best bodies in Brooksville High.

"You think?" she said, in a voice that combined doubt and hopefulness. "You're the first guy to ever have seen them. Are they really OK?"

"OK?" I said. "They are scrumptious. They are perfection. You've got the perkiest, sweetest, most boner-inducing breasts in three counties. They are simply gorgeous!"

Her eyes filled up with tears. A pause. "Thank you," she said, quietly. "I always thought I was ugly. But maybe... "

I sat up. "Maybe nothing. You have a stunning body. I'll bet if your folks let you dress a little more... flattering... you'd have guys fighting in the halls to go out with you."

She giggled and wiped a tear. "Well, I don't want to go from a dog to a slut overnight," she said. "Maybe I'll just practice for a while... on you."

And she lowered her face to my crotch again and began to suck with a passion and flair than even her previous efforts had not reached.

Even at 14, two hard, strong cums in a row would be enough to put the typical penis on the sidelines for 20 minutes or so. But that wasn't the case when Amanda was at work.

It was just a few strokes that brought me back up to full-staff. It was just a minute or two before that now-familiar feeling was tingling in my balls and prostate. And with her firm, sweet naked tits brushing sexily against my bare thighs, I felt the sensation getting closer and closer.

"Oh, Amanda, you are just the best... " I moaned and patted her hair.

"Mhmmm, there's more," she said, and snaked one hand beneath my rolling buns. A spit-greased finger quickly tunneled into my tight anus, and I felt it probing around, and then a delightfully exciting itching inside my rectum.

My finger in my ass; her mouth on the head of my cock; her tongue on the shaft; her tits on my legs. The two previous cums were just a minor memory now; I was clearly headed for something historic here.

It overcame me quite suddenly. This violent eruption just burst out of my ass and balls and out through my flared cocktip. Pulse after pulse of my schoolboy semen rocketed out, into Amanda's sucking mouth.

I groaned and yelled. "OH, GOD AMANDA! SO FUCKING GOOD! I'M CUMMING SO FUCKING HARD! KEEP DOING IT! SO GOOD!"

She took her mouth off my cock and sat back a little as she continued to finger-fuck my ass and stroke my fountaining peter. Only now the copious stream was aimed at her firm, white breasts and erect, tingly nipples.

"UNHHHH! UNGGHHH! UNGGH!" I grunted as I raised up off the ground and shot and shot and shot in thick, chunky splats against her heaving, perking bosom.

Forget the two ejaculations that had preceded it; this one was gigantic; in volume and pleasure and forcefulness, this climax was truly epic. Her pert tits and throat and flat belly were soon streaked and smeared with my sperm, and even after the arcing streams stopped, each stroke of her hand milked out another thick glob of cum.

At last, I was empty and sated. I collapsed dreamily onto the turf and Amanda chuckled softly as she cleaned my warm semen from her body. Most of it went into a series of Kleenex tissues; some of it was scooped up and put in her mouth.

Rebuttoned, Amanda lay down beside me and spoke softly.

"I don't really understand you," she said. "I see you talking with the principal and flirting with the cheerleaders -- the seniors, even! -- and the other day I heard you were having dinner at Carol Pitocki's house. Yet, here you are with me, the homeliest girl in the whole freshman class. Being so nice to me and complimenting me and making me feel like a woman, and not some freak."

"You are not homely; you are not a freak and you are most definitely a sexy woman. Or woman-to-be. All you need is maybe a new wardrobe and a hairstyle and... "

"Confidence," she said. "I can't get that from the store. Although," she said, reaching down and cupping my crotch, "I think I might be getting some from you."

I smiled. "Oh, yes," I said. "Confidence is contagious. A confident person can help make other people confident, too."

"Sort of like a vampire?" she teased.

"That sucks!" I retorted.

"No, I suck," she replied. "You cum and cum and cum and cum. And the more of your sweet cum I swallow, I think the more confident I'm going to be."

Chapter 3
Posted: August 02, 2003 - 12:00:00 am

I was always one of those driveway heroes; you know, the type of guy who would spend hours shooting baskets all alone, monkeying up do-or-die scenarios in which the game is on the line, three seconds, two seconds...

A lot of being able to shoot a basketball accurately is muscle-memory; your reflexes taking over due to constant repetition, sort of like typing. The other part is confidence; a combination of focus and relaxation that allows the best aspects of an athlete's total self to come forward.

Now, I was never a great ballplayer; I'm not very tall -- just 5-foot, 10 inches tall now as an adult, and just 5-7 when I entered high school -- can't dribble the ball behind my back and my defense was always not much better than workmanlike. But...

"Aw, there's always a place on the team for someone who can shoot," said Uncle Mike one afternoon, watching me bomb in baskets from beyond the 3-point line that was designated by a crack in the driveway.

This was a few days after the incident with the baseball bat, and my mind was a maelstrom of conflicting impulses; a new-found urge to take risks, and the same old fears still hanging on with their fingernails.

"So you going to go out for basketball this year, Jack, me boy?" asked Uncle Mike, lighting up a Lucky Strike.

"Uh, well, I'm not sure," I said. "Don't have a lot of formal experience. Wonder if the coach will give me a chance."

"Fuck that!" snorted my uncle. "Listen, bucko, remember this: there's only one good play in basketball: the ball goes in the hoop. You can take all that no-look pass and between-the-legs dribbling and shove it in your ass. Score! That's the first and last word in any coach's playbook."

I considered that for a moment. I was about 25 feet away from the hoop. I turned, set myself and went up with the shot. An easy release, a perfect arc, and the barely audible sound of the plastic-ball swishing through the nylon netting. I did believe that every shot would go in! Stripped of the fear of failure or embarrassment, I went from shooting about 35 percent to nearly double that. A goofy grin beamed from my face.

"I think I'll give it a try," I said.

With the fervor of the newly-converted, I tracked down the freshman basketball coach, who was none too glad to see me. I hadn't played in the summer league and I was a complete -- and unimpressive -- stranger to him.

"Coach, just give me five minutes in the gym. If I don't earn a spot on the team in that time, I'll go away and never bother you again," I said, looking him right in the eye.

"Well," he said, after a long moment, "you've got confidence, I'll give you that. OK. Five minutes."

"You wanna warm up first?" he said, tossing me a ball once we were inside the cavernous gym.

"Coach," I said, "I was born warm." Yes, I know, there is a point where confidence starts to bleed into arrogance, but as the saying goes, it ain't bragging if you can do it. And I knew I could do it.

Now, of course, I knew it might be different with the pressure of a crowd yelling, or the other team defending, but none of that occurred to me at the moment. There was no coach watching, no possibility of bricklaying, just me making love to the hoop with that big fat, orange ball.

Nine-out-of-10 free throws. Fifteen-of-20 from beyond the three-point arc. "You care to see my hook shot?" I asked.

"No, no," he said. "If you can shoot half that well in a game you're already better than three of my starters I got penciled in. Team meeting is here at 3 p.m. Friday. I'll see you there."

I knew that the most important people in a high school aren't the principal or even the teachers but the janitors and the secretaries. They knew what was really going on and could make things happen if they were so inclined.

Anxious to get a chance to practice in the gym with no one else around, I befriended the head custodian. A couple of days of complimenting him on the truly wonderful work he and his staff did keeping the campus clean in the face of the total indifference of 2,000 sloppy teenagers, and a lengthy inquiry into his own sports career produced the desired result.

"Now, Mack," I said, holding up the key he'd presented me with. "Are you sure this isn't going to get you into any trouble?"

He snorted. He was a short, wrinkled black man whose appearance betrayed little evidence than he had once been -- a long time ago -- a blindingly fast high school point guard until a war wound cut short a promising career at age 19. "Shit, boy," he said, waving away the thought with a gnarled hand. "Coaches are always forgetting to lock the doors. People sneak in all the time. Just don't tell anybody about the key, or let them see you use it, and it's cool."

"Hey," I said, "you are the man. You need any help cleaning up the gym after the game? I could lend a hand."

Mack drew in a breath. "Damn," he said. "No, I don't need any help, but, boy, you are the first student in 22 years to offer to lift a finger to help me. I think maybe you the only kid in this whole school got his head screwed on right."

We shook hands and parted. That night at about 8 p.m. I hoofed it down back to school, and -- looking both ways like the good junior burglar I'd become -- let myself into the gym. When I flicked on the lights I was stunned to see somebody else there: a wiry sophomore girl named Joanne who was just lacing on her shoes when my eyes fell on her.

"What are you doing here?" she asked defensively.

'What are YOU doing here?" I replied. "How did you get in?"

"Coaches leave the doors unlocked a lot. I sneak in all the time," she said, standing there with a ball at her hip. She was about 5-foot, 4-inches tall, wearing a sloppy gray sweatshirt and baggy red shorts. Her brown hair was a little bit on the frizzy side, and her face was freckled. No makeup or lipstick, not much fashion sense but a hint of potential. I thought that perhaps this was one of those girls who might, as my Uncle Mike would say, "cleaned up good."

"OK, great," I said. "My name is Jack. I'm gonna be on the freshman team this season, I think." I walked over to her and held out a hand. She just looked at me.

"I don't care much for boys," she said, her face set in a hard expression.

I thought for a moment. Into my mind flitted memories of some of the bullies and jerks and others of my gender who'd stained my life's path.

"You know," I said, looking right into her eyes, "a lot of the time I don't either." Then I grinned.

Her face softened, a smile tugged at her bare lips. "You any good with that thing?" she asked, then blushed at her awkward choice of words. "I meant the basketball."

I laughed and bounced her the ball. "Do or die, right?"

In a minute we were friends, sort of. Joanne was a darned good basketball player, a natural point guard with great court sense and a dogged defender. She was going to be elevated to the girls' varsity as a sophomore, which was sort of a big honor.

Our one-on-one games were close, hard-fought and, frankly, quite sexy. She defended like a demon, and didn't let me get a step if she could help it. I quickly learned that I was going to stand a chance, I'd have to bomb in the ball from outside before she could go into her bulldog act.

Which I did. After she won the first game 20-15, I started to arc the ball over her. If she came out too far to defend me, I would put my shoulder down and drive past her. I won the second game 20-10 and the third 20-6.

"Damn," she said as we collapsed sweatily onto the bleachers on a break. "I wish I could shoot that well. That's the main thing I really need to improve on."

We traded Gatorades back and forth, an odiferous camaraderie growing between us. "Well," I said, working a towel over my salty face, "you know a lot of shooting well is just confidence. You've got to believe that every shot's going to go in. I mean really believe it. Then you relax and it just sort of happens."

She grinned and stretched. "A lot of things I need more confidence about," she said. A pause. "Why are boys such assholes? Present company excluded."

"C'mere," I said, and motioned her over and gestured for her to sit down in front of me. Warily, she did so, and I started to rub her shoulders and neck.

"Here's the way I see it," I started, kneading her lithe, taut, sweaty body from hairline to shoulder blades. "At our age -- like junior high and up -- everybody's so insecure that they're worried about being laughed at or put down. So they figure the simplest way to avoid that is to laugh at or put down somebody else. The effect can be cruel, but the intent isn't mean, really; it's just a crappy form of self-defense."

I could feel her body begin to relax under my touch. "Hmmmm," she moaned. "That feels pretty good for a dickhead guy," she joked.

"Hey, and you're a pretty good basketball player for a ball-busting bitch," I said, continuing to work out the kinks and knots in her muscled back and neck.

She giggled. Then there was a silence. Then she spoke.

"OK, so confidence. How did you get to be so confident about everything?" she asked, turning to face me. At that moment she looked awfully cute. The closeness of our bodies had produced its effect; my pants were tight and my groin was heating up.

"Is it just me, or it getting really hot in here?" I said, leaning in to her, my lips millimeters from hers.

She didn't draw back; her voice became lower and more husky. "Don't change the subject," she said, as she looked into my eyes.

"I'm not, really," I said. "In my case I got my confidence after a transcendent experience." I moved closer.

"Transcendent," she said, her lips parting slightly. "What if I were to ask you to transcend me?" she said, almost in a whisper. Our breaths mingled.

Now, some people don't like sweaty, but I always have. Our lips locked and we pulled at each other's sweat-stained clothes. Between kisses that become progressively more urgent and penetrating, Joanne managed to blurt out, "I've never done this before." Then a pause and a giggle. "With a dickhead guy, I mean."

With her sweatshirt and sturdy sports bra pulled over her head, I fastened my mouth onto one of her large, dark brown and deliciously erect nipples and began to suck. "Me neither," I said, then added. "With a dickhead guy, that is."

We went down into a chortling tangle of arms and legs and shoelaces. Spotting a rolled-up wrestling mat against a nearby wall, we migrated, leaving a trail of socks, underwear and perspiration. On the mat we sat staring at each other; our young bodies taut with desire; her nipples stiff and aching, my cock jerking and leaking, our chests heaving.

"I'm... I'm gonna kill the lights," I finally said.

"They all look alike in the dark, eh?" she smirked, an edge coming into her voice.

"No, no," I replied. "You look so sexy my heart hurts. I just have a feeling that in the shadows it will just be that much more... special."

She liked that. In fact, she liked the dark so much that when I return to her she immediately engulfed my twitching prick with her sweet mouth and began to suckle at it.

After a minute or two of fervent licking and slurping at my adolescent cock, she popped her head off the purple head and smacked her lips. "Never thought I'd like what's been a man's legs, but damn, that is tasty."

I pushed her on her back, splayed her firm legs (with a bit more leg hair than is fashionable) and hooked them over my shoulders. I buried my face between her strong thighs and started to lave at her cunny and clit. In a minute she was moaning and jerking.

"Ohh, god!" she cried. "Oh my fuckin' god!" she said, thrusting her lean body up against my mouth. "Don't... you... dare... make... me... cum, you wonderful fucking dickhead!"

"Yeah," I muttered between licks of her soaked groin. "Payback's a bitch!"

"Oh, god, yes, and so am I!" she groaned, wriggling and arching her lean naked body. Her small, firm breasts bobbled slightly, her round, juicy asscheeks tightened and her flat belly rippled as the feeling of erotic ecstasy rolled through her 15-year-old body.

I could sense her approaching her climax and decided it might be something fun to share. I slowed my oral worship, which made her wriggle her bottom frantically. "Don't stop," she whined, finally.

"I know something better," I said. "Something will make us both happy."

She moaned again in frustration. "Noo, noooo," she said, still trying to capture my tongue with her needy loins. "Just let me... please!"

Part of me wanted to bargain my way for my aching prick into her cunt, but that didn't seem right, either. So I put that thought aside and went back to licking her eager and needy womanliness.

Another minute, at most, and she was on the ragged edge, just hanging there. "Uhhh -- iuhh -- uhhh! God! OK, put it in! Just hurry up, you dickhead!" she grunted.

Not having to be asked twice, I mounted her lithe form, lined up my cock with her quivering quim and slid it in all the way to my 14-year-old balls.

"OHHHMYFUCKING GOD!" she screamed. Her cunt exploded, grabbing powerfully at my loins and flexing. Her muscular body arched off the mat and almost lifted me into the air. She shrilled and grunted into my ear; she was a wildcat I had to wrestle, to satisfy with my own frantic organ.

I started to thrust in and out of her spasming love tunnel, and to my surprise, that started to set off another climax. Her body undulated and she gasped for breath; in the dim light of the darkened gym with just some reflections from moonglow for illumination her face looked just like I imagined mine did when Uncle Jack had administered his lesson.

Now, I have probably done some pretty rotten things in my life. But I think I will always be proud of what happened next.

As she writhed and sucked in air and fought for control of her sweaty spasming body, I leaned down and whispered in her ear.

"You are wonderful. You are beautiful. You are a star. Every shot goes in. Every one is a friend. The crowd loves you. You are so special!"

I don't know if she heard it, really; she seemed only semi-conscious as I hammered my cock into her and repeated the mantra in a low, hypnotic voice. She climaxed again and again until she finally fell limp with erotic exhaustion.

As for me, I didn't cum. But few experiences ever were so satisfying. We cuddled up there on the mat in the moonglow, kissed goodnight sweetly and left in silence.

I would see her on campus after that night and she would give me a big enthusiastic wave. When we crossed paths she'd give me a great hug and affectionately call me her "favorite dickhead." When basketball season started, her coaches and teammates noticed a change in her playing.

Instead of being a stolid journeyman guard, dutifully bringing the ball up the court and distributing it humbly to her more glory-bound betters, she was turning the game into a joyous ballet. Her strides got longer and faster; her passes graceful and elegant and perfectly timed. And she started to shoot the lights out of the scoreboard.

I loved to go to the girls' games and watch her roaring across the hardwood, a bright smile on her freckled face, her play the picture of pure pleasure and confidence. Sometimes -- even in a game -- she would spot me in the stands and make a friendly gesture. And she would show up at my freshman games to cheer me on and shout insults at the other team.

We didn't date, exactly; we did meet every couple of weeks or so in the gym to play two sweaty games of one-on-one: one vertical and one horizontal. When she graduated and got a scholarship to a all-girls private school, she sought me out in her cap and gown to give me a hug and cry on my shoulder.

"It'll never be the same," she sniffed. "Hell, if all men were like you, I wouldn't even be going to a women-only college. Thank you so much for everything."

"You'll do great!" I told her, rubbing her back with one hand and getting a little misty myself. "Just promise me you'll come home on vacations and spare a little time for an old friend."

She pulled back and looked me in the face. "Hey, of course; a girl never forgets her favorite... "

"Don't say it!"

"I won't," she replied. "I think we're a little grown-up for that."

She stepped back and moved away. After a moment I turned and started to leave. And then I heard a familiar voice.

"See you this summer, dickhead!"

Chapter 4
Posted: August 02, 2003 - 12:00:00 am

I was deciding that things were going just too well to be believed one day when it became clear that I come to that conclusion much too soon. It was the lunch hour at Brooksville High School, and trouble was brewing just a couple of dozen yards from me.

It was during Desert Storm, the 1991 Gulf War, that this happened. One of our students, a slight, shy guy named Hassam, had the bad judgment to be born of Arab background at a time when testosterone-poisoned white teenage boys decided to strike a blow for jingo-ism by roughing him up in the halls.

"Hey, Ass-am," jeered one beefy lineman, grabbing the terrified student and shoving him roughly into the arms of another gridiron genius, "Go screw a camel, why don't ya?"

"Yeah," laughed his partner in human pitch-and-toss, clutching a fistful of the lad's wiry hair, "Isn't that what Mohammer did? Screw with camels?"

I was standing there talking with my friend, a fellow basketball hopeful with the unfortunate name of Ed Normal. He was a light-skinned black who sometimes himself felt the sting of being on a long-end of majority-minority equation in this suburban community.

"Mohammer," I said. "These guys are dumber than a barrel of hair." I looked on in anger for another minute of this corridor cruelty, then put down my books and shrugged off my jacket. "Stand up for the weak" echoed through my brain like a mantra.

"You wanna give me a hand with this?" I asked Ed.

He looked at the odds; seven or eight football players against two skinny freshmen, and shook his head. "Don't think so," he said quietly.

Then we heard one of the footballers giggle as he twisted poor Hassam's ear painfully. "Christ, Assam, your hair's almost as kinky as a nigger's! And you almost smell as bad, too."

Ed put down his books and pushed his sleeves up his wrists. "I just changed my mind," he said.

Now, you might think than this was foolhardy in the extreme. And so would I, had I not received that unconventional training from Uncle Mike.

The summer before, shortly after the incident with the baseball bat, he was watching a boxing match on the TV when I came home from one of my nocturnal ramblings at the basketball courts of a nearby park.

He was hunched in a chair, sipping on a beer and scowling as the pugilists on the screen clutched and held and generally avoided doing much fighting.

"Buncha sissies," he grunted, taking another sip. Then he noticed me. "Ah, Jack, me boy, you're just in time for another tutorial."

I blinked; I wasn't sure what this would mean. "Is it going to hurt?" I asked.

He stood up and stretched, "Oh, well, it's like hearing the truth; it only hurts the first time and then you're a better man for having heard it, aren't you?"

I wasn't sure what that meant, but in the rush of my new-found drive and enthusiasm for life, I was game for any new insight my eccentric Uncle Mike might impart.

In a split-second, he reached out and grabbed me by the hair, spun me around and bent my right arm -- painfully -- high up against my back.

"What -- are -- you -- doing?" I grunted, trying to kept from getting a dislocation and a scalping at the same time. He twisted my hair a little more and put a little more pressure on my aching arm.

"OWWwwwwWWW!" I wailed. "You're fighting dirty!"

He chuckled and whispered into my ear. "Ah, but is it working?" he asked.

"Jeez, yes, -- oww -- yes, you're right, you win!" I yelped.

With that he let me go and stood back, arms crossed across his chest. I patted my poor aching follicles and worked the sparks out of my twisted arm and elbow.

"Now, Jack, me boy, what did you learn from all of that?" he asked, smiling and rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet.

"That you fight dirty," I pouted. Then I caught the look in his eye. And the light came on in my own. "And it works!"

He really smiled now. "That's right! Jack, a gentleman never picks a fight, but when one is forced upon him he uses all available resources to prevail. In your case, not being what I'd call a huge physical specimen you might find yourself up against some big bully of a bastard. Fight him fair and he'd wipe up the floor with you. What's fair about that? But fight like you mean to win and now it's a more level playing field."

I frowned. "Yeah, but what if it just makes him madder?"

He waved that away. "Just a myth, Jack. Bullies are cowards. You give them a nice, sharp, memorable bit o' pain, and that's what they'll remember. They mess with you and yours, and they'll be limping for days. Do that, and they'll give you a wide berth, believe me."

I thought about that for a while. "Got any more... boxing... tips?" I asked with a grin.

The chief jerk tormenting poor Hassam was Wally Fuller, or WalMart as he was known because of his size. Six-foot-two, 220 lbs., he was easily the most formidable-looking student at Brooksville High, but fortunately, not the brightest. This day he was in his usual uniform of short, blond hair, blue jeans, Nikes and a red-and-black varsity jacket.

The group of football players were having so much fun they hardly noticed our arrival.

"Say, Fuller," I said, as I stood about five feet away from him. "The way you grab that guy I'm not sure if you want to hurt him or screw him."

That brought a chuckle from the students who had gathered around to watch the fun.

Fuller spat and pushed Hassam aside.

"Why don't you dance with a man for a change?" I said.

"You little faggot!" said Fuller, balling up his fists. "I'll kick your fairy ass."

I looked him right in the eye -- well, I looked right up into his eyes -- and replied.

"You sure have this thing about faggots and asses. Do your buddies know about this? I mean, this latent inversion?"

Wally looked confused. A couple of spectators snickered. His face got redder and redder.

"You... fuckin'... jagoff... asswipe!" he sputtered.

"Again with the ass-thing," I shot back. "So do you like to fuck ass or take it up your ass?"

The laughter that began with snickers grew into a bit of a roar. Wally's face went briht red. And I knew I had him. I remembered what Uncle Mike had said to me.

"When a man's face is white, it means all the blood has rushed to his muscles as his body goes into its fight-or-flight response," he said. "But when it goes red, that means the blood has left returned, and he's no longer a dangerous man, no matter what he says."

Wally was more afraid of being humiliated than he was of physical pain. And I was prepared to give him both.

He moved forward, awkwardly, his fists up, his face still scarlet. He took a wild, awkward swing at me, which I easily deflected. Just as Uncle Mike had taught me, I then stepped inside and stomped on his lead foot. Wally howled in pain, raised his foot and -- thus unbalanced -- he toppled over.

"Let me help you," said Ed said, moving forward and stepped on Wally's hand.

"Dirty nigger!" screeched Wally in a childlike voice.

What could have turned into god-knows-what quickly took a turn for the surreal. The principal, Ellen McCarthy was standing there, hands on her hips, a stern look on her face. "Who said that?" she yelled. "Racial insults will not be tolerated at this school!"

At her side was the burly vice principal. "You guys," he said, pointing at the football players. "My office. Now."

The principal turned to me and Ed. "You two. My office. Now."

Ed and I sat in the outer office of the principal's office for just a few minutes. Miss McCarthy came out and spoke first to Ed. "I was watching the whole thing from my office window, and I believe that the chief instigator of this fracas was Jack, here, so I'm going to let you off with a warning, Ed. You may go to class."

Relieved, he stood up, gave me a wry "Good luck, fella" look and walked out.

"You," she said, in that no-nonsense voice that cowed people much bigger and older. "Time to face the music."

The door closed behind me, and -- to my surprise -- the door was also purposefully locked. The blinds on the high windows in her office with closed tight as well. "Don't sit down," she said.

Ellen McCarthy was what I used to call one of those two-way females, and I don't mean bisexual. I mean that with the right sort of incentive, she looked like she could either be an annoying, controlling bitch or a hot-blooded sexy nymph. Not that those were the only two choices in the world, but being just 14 years old, that was the limit of my imagination. As it turned out, she was much more imaginative than me.

"I saw and heard what you did out there," she said in an even voice. "Officially, I have to chastise you for engaging in fighting in the halls." She looked at me sternly and pointed a finger. "You must never, ever do that again." A tiny smile tugged at the edge of her mouth.

"But on the one hand, I understand that teenage boys have tremendous levels of energy which sometimes find inappropriate expression. And on the other hand, I think what you did was the bravest, most admirable thing I've ever seen on a high school campus," she said, moving in close to me.

Gulp. Up close I could see -- and smell -- that Miss McCarthy was not just another hardass board-of-education bureaucrat. She was smallish, about 5-foot, 3-inches, with a slender but shapely frame. Her blonde hair was cut fashionably short, and she dressed in professional but stylish clothes. This day she was wearing a tan suit with a red blouse, which set off her red lips and the red brooch on her perky bust.

"In consequence of that, I have to tell you that from time to time, I select a student -- a male student -- for some advanced counseling, especially troubled youth such as yourself," she said, moving closer and closer so I could deeply inhale the light lilac scent of her perfume. Her lips were an inch from mine, and her taut body was starting the brush up against my chest. "Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?" she breathed in the lowest, softest, sexiest voice I'd ever heard.

"Uh, yeah," I croaked, as my teenage crank began to wind up to full hardness in my tight jeans.

"Good," she whispered. Then she reached down and began to unbutton my jeans. "Stand still and don't say a word," she said. The jeans came open and she began to tug them down my thighs, an action which revealed my fully tumescent adolescent cock straining manfully at the white cotton of my briefs.

With another tug, she pulled my jeans down to my ankles, leaving them there. Then she grabbed the waistband of my underwear and pulled it out in front, so that it cleared the dipping tip of my penis. "Mmmm," she said, and then yanked that garment down to my feet.

She stepped back and reached down to undo what was now obviously a wrap-around skirt. Underneath it was the firm, toned body of a hot, sexy woman covered only by a tiny thong panty. She sat down at her chair and motioned me over. "Over my lap," she said.

Somewhat awkwardly I assumed the position, my drooling young cock now pressed between her wonderful thighs and my buns facing up.

"You know you have to be punished," she said, then ran a caressing cool hand over my asscheeks. "Are you prepared" -- here a slim finger traced a teasing course through the valley of my buns -- "to accept whatever punishment I might mete out? Today and in future counseling sessions?"

It was kinky, but was pretty darn exciting, too. "Uh, sure," I said. I would have said anything to get her to keep touching my agitated flesh.

"Very well," she said. She shifted in her seat and reached down with one hand to grasp my bone-hard 14-year-old stiffy. "The first thing I want you to learn is that there's a thin line between pain and pleasure." And with that she hit my butt with the hardest spank I'd ever gotten.

"Yikes!" I yelped.

'Shhhhhh!" she hushed. "Didn't I tell you to be quiet?" Then she tightened her lower hand around my throbbing cock and pulled down in an exquisite milking motion that caused my balls to throb and my asshole to pucker. Damn, she was good.

And so it went. She spanked my increasingly red buttocks with one hand while she expertly jerked on my swelling, leaking prick. "You must learn to express yourself without resorting to violence," she said as she pleasured and punished me. "Hitting never solved anything." I had to smile through my grimaces.

She alternated spanks with caresses and teasing probes of my defenseless anus. With a sexy middle-aged woman fingering your asshole, spanking your quivering behind and power-stroking your dick, you're swimming in a warm pool of sensual excitement, especially is this is all happening to you as a high school freshman.

"And you must learn self-control in other ways as well," she said, pushing me off her lap and standing up. She stripped off her now-sopping black thong panties and motioned for me to sit in her chair. Without a word she climbed on top of my half-nude body and lowered her dripping, shaved snatch to a position a couple of millimeters from my yearning purple cocktip.

"Rule number one. No cumming without permission. Rule number two: no talking about this with anybody. Rule number three: I'm still the principal, so even if I beg you to pound my tight hot cunt, you will treat me with respect, here and outside of this room. Deal?"

"Deal!" I croaked, straining up from the chair to try to touch that heavenly flesh with my famished cock.

"OK," she said, with a naughty smile. "Get ready to get educated." She fitted her cuntlips against the purple helmet of my penis and sank slowly down.

"Mmmmmmmm," she moaned throatily. "I like this. I think you are going to need lots of counseling sessions." Then she reached into a drawer, pulled out a thick role of duct tape and began to tear off strips.

Feeling her experienced cunt massage my eager adolescent cock distracted me from the import of this action, but in a few second it became clear. She applied a thick piece of tape over my mouth and then wound another long string around my wrists, which she hooked over the protruding high backpiece of the chair. I was now a prisoner of a horny, dominating high school principal.

"Mmmm," she said, rocking and grinding her liquid cunt all round my rock-hard member, flooding my groin and thighs with her juices. "Love this hard teenage cock! You young boys all get so fuckin' stiff and fuck like young bulls! But no cumming unless I say so, you nasty little prick!" To emphasize the point, she raked her long, red fingernails across my chest. It hurt, but not bad enough to materially distract from the insane pleasure her supple pussy-muscles were giving my teenage rod.

"You be a good boy and keep those hot schoolboy balls in check until I tell you to let them loose and I'll have you in here every other day giving you some schooling that every swingin' dick on this campus would like to get," she said, still rising and falling on my upthrust manhood.

I was feeling the semen in my balls and prostate begin to churn and boil, but I knew that unless I held back, I would jeopardize my chance to fuck this sexy nympho principal for the next four years, so I literally bit my lip and clenched my asshole and cocktube shut.

"Mmmm, you hot little fucker," she cooed in my ear, then licked it and nibbled on the earlobe. "Love your stiff cock! Ellen loves getting your hard, throbbing boystick deep in her naughty cunt! Keep it hard for me, lover! I wanna get off on a stiff, solid cock of a helpless little teenage sex toy like you. Mmmm, keep it so rigid for me, Jack, my sweet little dildo-honey. I love to ride it so fuckin' much!"

And she did. She licked my throat and nibbled on my nipples and even nuzzled my armpits with her sweet, sweaty face. My cock went into absolute blood-lock -- it was perfectly hard and solid; not one more drop of blood could have fit in there. I just leaned back and stared at the ceiling as Miss McCarthy continued to top-ride me.

"UGHHHH!" she grunted, her cries getting louder. "GETTIN' CLOSE, JACK! GONNA BE A BIG ONE! GOD, THIS FEELS SO PISSIN' GOOD! FUCK! SO FUCKIN' HARD AND LONG IN MY LITTLE CUNT! ALMOST... I'M ALMOST... OH GOD! OH SWEET GOD!" she veritably screamed. "I'M CUMMING! I'M CUMMING SO HARD! CUM, JACK! CUM IN MY CUNT NOW!"

I'd glad she gave me permission because the way her cunt was sucking and nipping at my cock I couldn't have held back any longer. I arched up off the chair and slammed my dick upwards, trying to get every last superheated inch into her spasming pussy.

I grunted wordlessly while my cock fired off thick, hot spurts of potent cum deeply into her writhing cunt. Splat after splat of my virile teen sperm slammed into her pussy as she moaned and cried and jerked about.

"YES, JACK! CUM IN ME YOU WONDERFUL HARD-COCKED BOY! FLOOD MY TIGHT HOT CUNT! FUCK ME! CUM IN ME! GOD, I'M CUMMIN' NON-STOP YOU WONDERFUL LITTLE FUCKER!"

I kept spurting and she kept undulating and twisting in ecstasy on top of me. Ropes of my cum jetted out into her; waves of female juices soaked my thighs, balls, legs and even dripped down to my feet.

Finally, light-headed, I relaxed, my cock still hard in her cunt but my balls finally satisfied and empty-feeling. She collapsed against my chest and we both breathed heavy, raspy gasps. After a long moment, she moved her mouth to my ear and spoke.

"Three things," she whispered. "You just passed the most important test of your life. Second. Report here tomorrow at 3 p.m. Leave your underwear at home. And thirdly, isn't soundproof insulation for office a wonderful idea?"

One.

Dennis Gilbert was probably the most "sensitive," reserved soul at Brooksville High. Jenny Kennedy was about the most outgoing and brash. Who would have thought that their stories would be connected?

A sophomore, Dennis was slight and pale, one of those kids for whom the rough-and-tumble of high school was sure to be strewn with mishaps. And I just missed this one.

As I walked along the main drag of our campus I heard a thump, a few words and a burst of vulgar laughter. A few more strides and I came upon the scene: Dennis laying on his back, his books scattered, the knees of his pants scuffed and his face red.

"You OK, man?" I said, offering him a hand up, which he took.

"What happened?" I inquired, once we had recovered the spilled texts and other effects.

"Oh, the usual," said the blond-haired boy, brushing some dirt from his shirt. "Some of the local adolescent hoi polloi think that tripping me is tres amusement."

I didn't say it, but it occurred to me that using terms like "hoi polloi" and "tres amusement" -- French, right? -- were contributing to his problem. He was regarded as the sophomore class wimp. His appearance, his speech, the mystery behind why he never dressed for physical education classes all put a big metaphorical "kick me" sign on his back for those blockheads who wouldn't know a metaphor from a machine gun.

It troubled me that man -- that, is, boy -- could be so indifferent to the sufferings of his fellow man, er, boy, but I have to say that my attention was a little big distracted.

The school day was over and it was Wednesday, which meant it if it were a month later, it would have been time to meet Jenny Kennedy, the head cheerleader and a special friend of the most intimate sort. My pants always got tight just thinking about what lay ahead.

How I hooked up with Jenny, a gorgeous senior, was more than a story; it was more like a case history in psychology, maybe abnormal psychology.

Jenny, vibrant Jenny, was not only head cheerleader, she was president of the pep club, which consisted -- this year -- entirely of girls. I'm not trying to make any kind of social statement here, but the club decided that it needed some help -- preferably male -- in climbing ladders, hauling paint cans and otherwise decorating the campus for the big homecoming football game.

"You, you and you," said my basketball coach, one day at practice, pointing at me and two other poor souls. "You just volunteered to be the work detail to help out the pep club."

As conscription went, it wasn't bad duty. We got to associate -- "hang out" would be too strong a term -- with some of the minor queens and princesses of our high school while we tried our best to impress them with our sweaty masculinity. Not that it worked.

We did hang a spitload of signs and such, and Jenny -- as a reward -- offered to give us three boys a ride home in her cool convertible Mustang. By luck of the draw, the other two boys were shuttled home first.

Not a word passed between Jenny and I for the first long minute; she seemed lost in thought. I broke the silence.

"This is such a great car," I said. "Your parents must be really cool to get it for you."

Jenny sort of curled her pretty lip. "My parents are divorced. I live with my mom. My dad's a big jerk. I made him buy this for me."

"Well, he can't be that big of a jerk if he bought you such a fine automobile," I said, taking a position in which I did not really believe.

"Well, he is. Of course, he had help," she said, cryptically.

That was all the conversation until she dropped me off. "Thanks for the lift," I said. "Anytime you need help, just give me a yell."

Her face softened. "Well, thank you," she said. "Hey, I'm sorry if I've been kind of grumpy. I have a lot on my mind."

"Well, you look prettier grumpy than most girls do when they're smiling," I said, laying it on a little. "Don't forget my offer."

She nodded and put the car in gear, driving oh, about, 15 feet before braking. "What time do you get to school?" she asked, turning to me.

"Uh, I usually leave here about 7," I said. "I like to kind of clear my head in the morning and look over my homework and such when I'm fresh."

"Hmm," she said. Then "Bye" as her Mustang sped away.

"And what's on YOUR mind?" asked my Uncle Mike that evening, as I sat on my basketball in the driveway instead of tossing it at the hoop. "Gonna miracle the ball up with your ass?"

I cleared my throat, which I often did when cooking up some B.S. answer to an authority figure. Before I started my sentence, he waved me off.

"Don't try to snow me," he said, popping open a beer. "I've been bullshitted by doctors, lawyers, judges, hookers, shoe salesmen. I've been lied to by experts, me boy."

"Well," I said, "it's like this. There's this real sensitive, real smart kid at school. But the other kids treat him like a freak because he's got a big vocabulary, and he knows all about Shakespeare and Steinbeck and he doesn't play any sports or anything. He gets roughed up and pushed around a lot, and I was wondering if I should try to do anything about it."

"Oh, so now you're the new sheriff in town. You think you can go around righting all wrongs and avenging all evil," he said. taking a drink and wiping his mouth. "If you try to redress every grievance at your school you'll be at it 24 hours a day and still be backlogged."

"I guess," I admitted. 'I thought maybe there was something I could do for him. Maybe if I caught one of those jerks that bully him I could kick the jerk's ass and he'd lay off."

Uncle Mike drained the bottle and gestured with the empty. "I'm sure you could. But that'd be worse than nothing, because now he's the little faggot who needs to have some freshman do all his fighting for him."

I stood up and shrugged. "Well, then I don't know what to do," I said.

Uncle Mike was silent for a moment -- rare for him -- and then he spoke up. "Your friend, there, Mr. Gilbert. You said he was well-schooled in Shakespeare?"

I nodded.

"Well, Clark, me lad, have you ever considered the benefits of getting YOUR ass kicked?"

Two.

I bopped out of the house just as the clock showed "7:00" and began my walk to school. I was kind of pumped because Uncle Mike and I had worked out what seemed like a great scheme to strike a blow for justice on behalf of the downtrodden, i.e., Dennis Gilbert.

I hadn't gone a block when a sleek blue convertible Mustang pulled up. "Got any experience making cheerleading posters, fella?" came a voice.

It was Jenny, looking a lot happier than she had the night before.

"A little," I said. "I studied under the great Jenny Kennedy," I said, arching my eyebrows suggestively.

"Ha! You wish!" she said. "You wanna lift to school?"

A block passed. She hummed and tapped her hands on the steering wheel.

"You're in a good mood today," I said. "I'm sure it's the company."

She turned and gave me a slow smile. "You are the strangest boy. Most boys at this school think one of three things about me. They either are too scared to talk to me, or they think I'm a slut or they think I'm a frigid bitch," she said.

"Gosh," I said, "I can see why someone might be too shy to approach the head cheerleader, but those last two seem a little harsh."

She shook her head ruefully. "Actually, truth to tell, they're both right on." She looked at me. "What do you think of that?"

A beat. I looked her right in the eye, the way Uncle Mike had taught me. "I think you're the strangest girl. Most girls at this school think one of three things about boys. They're either too scared to speak honestly to them, or they think they're pigs ... or ... or ... oh, shit!" I said laughing, "I forget what the third thing was going to be."

She laughed back. You could feel the ice cracking. "Say, you wanna go for a drive before class starts?" she said. "We've got half-an-hour."

I was silent for a few blocks. It seemed like the smart thing to do. "So, you're a basketball player," she said, finally.

"Well, I'm a kid," I said, smiling. "Sometimes I play basketball, but that's not how I think of myself."

She nodded. "Yes, yes, that's how I feel, too. I'm a girl who happens to do cheerleading a few hours a week. I mean, your identity isn't defined by something you do, even something you did years ago... " she trailed off.

"Jenny," I said, "since we have been friends for, what, two days, I feel I can ask you this: what are so churned up about? And why are you so mad at your dad?"

She shook her head. Then, "Oh, what the hell. I've gotta tell somebody. For some reason ... Well, here goes..."

I listened with sober sympathy to her story. which she interrupted every minute or so with "I can't believe I'm telling you this."

Her father and her had been very close, all her life, maybe too close. It pushed her mother to the outskirts of the family, but what blew it apart was the night -- and the nights that followed -- when her father moved from a hug to a kiss on the forehead to a kiss on the lips.

She was 12, and she worshipped her daddy. His tongue in her mouth tasted good, and she felt herself get slick and itchy down between her legs as he drew the kiss out.

In a few minutes her tiny panties were dangling from one ankle, and she was groaning and mewling with pleasure as her father pushed down his shorts and slowly stroked his gnarly member into her preteen vagina.

"When we were doing it, I liked it, I have to admit," she said, searching my eyes for a sign of understanding. "But afterwards I felt like a dirty little tramp, and I promised myself I would never do it again. But then my dad would beg me and bug me until I agree to do it, and again it felt great -- until afterwards."

The pattern continued for over a year, when, at age 13, she was caught coming out of her father's den, pulling up her panties, a stream of semen rolling down her shapely thigh.

"My mom kind of freaked out," she said. "She threatened to have my dad arrested for being a child molester, which I guess he was. She was pretty hard on me, too, for going along with it. Well, to make a long story short, my folks got divorced, my mom has custody of me."

"So, you're mad at your dad for molesting you? I mean, of course, you're mad at your dad for molesting you."

She gave me an odd look. "Yes, that's true. But that's not all of it. What he did was a terrible thing, to take advantage of a 12-year-old girl. I feel really weird about letting anyone ... I mean, I don't even use a tampon. So that's why I don't date much; most of the guys are just trying to get into my little sugar scoop, and I'm tired of slapping people."

"Sure, I see," I said, nodding.

"Well," she said, heaving a big sigh. "There's more to it than that. I have like this real phobia about letting a guy's dick in my pussy. But all that fucking with my dad made me into a very horny girl. So I'm stuck. I can't stop craving a good, hard fuck and I can't let a guy fuck me in the pussy. See the dilemma?"

"Well," I said, letting out a small, nervous bark of laughter, "I guess you could always just let a guy do you in your behind."

Her eyes brightened. "God, would you?"

Three.

"I don't really think I need your assistance," said Dennis Gilbert, as he pulled himself up from his latest mishap involving a shove, and trip and a sprawl on the ground, this time in a muddy puddle.

"With all due respect, Dennis," I said, "I think you really could use a hand. And a towel."

"Very funny," he said. "What are you going to do, beat up every Neanderthal in this school? Even if you did, they'd just get their revenge on me as soon as they could."

I shook my head. "No, I have a different plan in mind. How would YOU like to beat ME up?"

The commotion that fights on a high school campus create always clogs the halls; it slows down the teachers and administrators that try to break them up. So Principal Ellen McCarthy had to watch from a distance as Dennis Gilbert and Jack Pozniak duked it out.

"I am so sick and tired of your ignorance, Pozniak," Dennis said, tossing aside his books. "I am not a man of violence, but you have pushed me too far."

I got into a fighter's stance, fists up, head ducked behind them. "C'mon, Gilbert. Are you gonna fight me or try to talk me to death?"

I heard a boy in the crowd remark to the other, "Pozniak is gonna kick his ass! He's the one that beat up that big football player! Man, he fights dirty."

Gilbert got into a different kind of crouch; right fist on his right hip, left fist upraised at shoulder-height. "I prefer to fight. I assume you wouldn't understand what I'm talking about anyway, you cretin."

We moved together and I led with a long, looping left, which he easily blocked. He stepped inside and give with four quick strikes to the chest and belly -- left-right-left-right with a twisting motion of the wrist.

I was still in midair, falling to the concrete walkway, when -- I swear! -- I heard the same spectator gasp and say "Shit! I didn't know Gilbert knew karate!"

I lay there writhing on the ground, gasping for breath, when the principal finally broke into the circle. "What is it with boys in this school and fighting?" she said. "Both of you in my office, now!"

In a minute we were standing tall before the principal.

"Now, what were you two knuckleheads fighting about?" she demanded.

"Well," I said, "it may seem kind of silly, but we were arguing about --"

"He says that the symbolism of the rose in 'The Scarlet Letter' represents the triumph of love, but to me, it's clearly an allusion to Christ's promise of redemption for the wicked," said Gilbert.

The principal gave us a skeptical look. "You expect me to believe that two high school boys got in a fist fight over Nathaniel Hawthorn?"

"Hawthorn rocks!" said Gilbert. "Melville is cool, and Scott is all right, but Dickens, man, Dickens is a PUSSY!"

She looked at us wonderingly and then spoke. "Gilbert, you wait outside. Pozniak, you stay. I want to hear 'your side' of this story."

When the door closed behind him, she sat down and propped her feet up on the desk, showing off a generous amount of thigh. "Well, I'm waiting," she said.

"You know how in 'Hamlet, ' there's a play inside a play?" I said. "Well, this is sort of like that. We cooked up this little battle so that people would stop picking on Dennis and regard him as a --"

"Badass motherfucker," she said, drily.

"Exactly. We figured that the whole karate thing would sell better because it seems kind of magical to the average suburban kid," I said.

"You never cease to amaze me, Jack," she said.

"Hey, " I said, leaning close to her. "You wanna really be amazed? Lemme tell ya the real reason why his parents got him out of P.E."

Four.

I think my favorite position in anal sex is when you push the girl's legs up, tilting her groin up and giving you a chance to fuck her ass from the front.

"You're not going to try to... " Jenny said as she squirmed deliciously, nakedly on the back seat of her Mustang.

"Put it in your undoubtedly heavenly little pussy?" I said. "No, no. I read about this once; this is gonna be so cool!' My cock was rock-hard; it always is when I fuck a girl's asshole. There is something thrilling about screwing a girl in that most forbidden of locations. It's like an admission on the girl's part that she's so hot for you, she'll do ANYTHING to have you inside her. And for the girl, I think, it's the last "virginity," the loss of which casts aside all reserve and shyness.

I had slicked my purple cockhead with baby oil (she now kept a bottle in her glove compartment: told people it prevented chapped hands) and started drilling in into the sweet pink-brown asspuckers of the moaning, undulating Jenny.

"Geez," she said, after a moment. "That IS good. I can really feel it both places," she said. "I think I'm gonna like this a lot."

"Oh, yes," was all I could say, as I started to saw my stiff rammer in and out slowly of the tightest, most scrumptious asshole in the whole world. "Oh, yes!"

She twitched her perfect rump back and forth. "Oh, God, that is so GOOD!" she said. "Who could ever think a cock up your ass could feel 10 times better than one in your cunt? Especially your cock in my ass!"

I picked up the pace, gripping her tiny waist with my sweaty hands. "You have a sexiest ass on the whole planet! Makes me almost squirt in my pants to see you in that tight cheerleader outfit, wiggling that perky ass all over the place!"

"God all mighty!" she cried, tightening her ass muscles on my flashing, blood-engorged cock, "Glad you saved all that hot cum for shooting off inside my ass instead!"

"Oh, Jenny, you gorgeous thing," I said, enthusiastically sodomizing the homecoming queen, "I don't think shooting off once in your ass is going to be enough! My balls are so full I'm gonna haveta rape your royal hot shitter more than once!"

"Yesss, yess," she moaned, pussy juices now flooding down to where my cock was hammering in and out of her gripping, sucking anus, "Rape my stuck-up, cock-teasing little butthole with your hard cock! Pound me! Pound me hard!"

"Your ... fuckin' wish ... is ... my command, princess," I said, gasping and thrusting myself balls-deep into the most desirable, and enigmatic girl in all of Brooksville High...

Five.

Later than day, I ran into the principal in the hallway. She laid a hand on my shoulder.

"Say, you need a scholarship or anything?" she asked, her face a little dreamy.

"Uh, you know, I'm a freshman. It's a little early to start thinking about scholarships, m'am," I replied.

"I know," she said, patting my head. "But I just want you to know how much I appreciate what you did yesterday."

"You mean helping out Dennis Gilbert?"

"No, silly. I mean helping out old Ellen McCarthy. When you told be about why he doesn't dress for P.E. because he has an enormous cock -- eight inches limp and 12 inches hard -- I just had to take him into my office for special counseling. In fact, he's in there right now, tied to the chair, duct tape on his mouth, blindfolded. I'm been riding him since first period; boy, when he comes, he comes a flood! I had to go to the ladies room to ... well, you know."

"Yeah, I do," I said. "I guess everyone has a hidden side to them. Who knows what you'll find about someone if you only have the guts to ask?"

"Amen," she said. "And who knows how much you can accomplish if you let someone else get the glory once in a while?"

One.

The fall of Ellen McCarthy came in a most unexpected way. But so did her rise.

The perky, thirty-something blonde principal of Brookville High School was about as well-liked as any administrator ever can be. Personable, she showed up at nearly every campus event, and with a great sense of humor, she seemed a perfect match for the many cross-currents that boil through a typical American secondary school.

If I were ever worried about how she might lose her job, it would probably focus mostly on her habit of "counseling" students, especially male ones. She found the business of being around 2000 or so young, sexy bodies incredibly arousing, and the knowledge that every one -- every single one!  of those male students had a potentially stiff dick in his pants just drove her nuts, no pun intended.

She had come to the local school district from a job as a college administrator. The school board folks were so impressed to have a former university bigwig apply for a principal's post they didn't inquire too closely into the circumstances surrounding her leaving the college job.

I was one of her favorite students, and she trusted me. I trusted her, certainly enough to let her tie me to a chair in her soundproof office with the opaque windows while she "provided guidance."

Your typical teenage boy might not regard a 37-year-old lady almost into middle age as a source of erotic desire, but Ms. McCarthy was an exception to any assumptions. She had a ravenous sexual appetite. Her firm B-cup breasts had almost no sag at all, and her nipples were a delicious dark brown and almost always erect.

She was no more than five or six pounds over her college weight, which just added enough to her cutely-rounded rump to make it even more voluptuous. All her body hair was shaved off, and the sight of that cute vertical slit was always enough to block out any other thought I might have in my mind. I loved the brushing of her honey-blonde hair on my shoulders or belly, the enthusiastic vulgarity of her couplings.

She loved to be on top, and I can remember clearly some of our conversations  usually rather one-sided  as she humped her always liquid and ripplingly snug "womanliness" all around and up and down my incredibly vertical, uh, boyhood. "God, Jack, can you believe it! I get to be a principal with all these lovely, firm young bodies ... I'm in charge of all of them," she would grunt as she rose and fell on top of my swollen cock. She was usually wearing a short, wide-hemmed or pleated skirt to make it easy for her to strip off her panties (when she wore them!) and mount some lucky male student for a quick session of serving as a human dildo. "I can just ... pull any of them into my office and, you know, have my way with them! All kinds of cocks and balls and such! So much wonderful variety! And why young men? Well, older men are OK but when they cum, they're done for a while. But young men, like hot studs like you, you can fuck and fuck all day, and when you shoot, you shoot like firehoses, Jack! I can feel your sperm blasting deep into my hot puss or in my tight winking little butthole. It's positively thrilling! Makes me feel so alive!" It was true, I guess. In a typical hour "counseling session" Ms. McCarthy would writhe on my body, or tie my hands behind me and bend over, demanding that I sodomize her cute, firm buns, and the result would be two or three strong, ball-emptying ejaculations at least. If she were especially needy, she would demand to not let me to return to class until I had serviced her a fourth or fifth time, and I could usually rise to the occasion. Of course, this was a pretty good deal for me, and also for the 100 or so other male students at Brooksville High that  at one time of another  she had "guided." She also, when the mood moved her, took under her wing (and between her legs) a dozen or so female pupils during her tenure.

I remember one time  on a rare instance when she actually listened to me, and didn't have me gagged and my mouth covered with duct tape  asking her about how, well, risky, it was to spread herself so thin, so to speak. "Oh, Jack," she said, clenching her talented anal muscles on my rock-hard teenage erection, "no one would ever rat on me. All my students love me ... especially the ones who REALLY love me," she said with a giggle. "Now stop talking and pound that spike deep in your poor needy principal's butthole and give her a nice hot load of boysperm to keep her warm until sixth period!"

Just what made Ms. McCarthy the kind of closet nymphomaniac she rarely did more than hint at. Looking back, I guess I could come up some kind of BS psychobabble theory about needing love. She remarked a couple of times about not having many dates in high school and college, but I think it's simpler than that. Once she finally did get "fulcrum" (as she sometimes called it, oddly) filled, she simply learned that she loved it, loved to fuck and would do anything she could to get herself "serviced."

"Yes, Jackie baby, that it's IT. That's fucking IT, you hard-cocked stud! SHOOT IT! RIGHT UP MY FULCRUM! Show me how much you ... OH GOD! YES! Christ, I love YOUNG COCKS! Lord help me, but I do I ... AHHHHHH ... I do!!!!!'

But it wasn't her perpetually itchy middle-aged "kitty" that got Mrs. McCarthy bounced from the job as principal of my high school. It was an addiction of another kind, entirely; the craving of power.

Two.

George Bell wanted to be a Congressman. I'm not sure if that is in his favor or against it, but the portly car dealership owner had his sights set on Washington, and getting elected to the local school board was Step One. Not especially bright or wise or public-spirited, Bell was at least aware of the fact that unless he did something really newsworthy, being a school trustee wouldn't give him much of a boost towards Capitol Hill. So he decided to become the voice of Education Reform. Now, don't get me wrong. There's a lot that's wrong with public schools today (and has been for years), but what George Bell was after was Publicity, not Public Service. He started ranting at board meetings about test scores. He began to hammer on the themes of "accountability" and "metrics" and obsessed (at least on stage) about the relative scores on standardized tests taken by students. Brooksville has three high schools. The oldest, of course, is Brooksville, the other two being Tidwell (a founding father of Brooksville) and Harrison (William Henry or Benjamin? We wondered if maybe it was named after George Harrison). One year, when the test scores came out, the three schools were all pretty close (within 10 points of each other, and all above the state average) but Brooksville was in last place.

Bell used that as an excuse to start complaining about Ms. McCarthy. He even visited the campus a couple of times to speak with her, and each time, he stalked out red-faced and angry.

He not only had spent a lot of his own money to finance his school board campaign, he had contributed to the war chests of two other successful candidates. So when three of the five members of the board voted to "reassign" Ms. McCarthy to an administrative post at the district and replace her with a new principal, it was a surprise to us students, but not to people who followed politics in town.

It wasn't just that I was losing a convenient (and incredibly willing) outlet for my teenage lust; I genuinely liked Ms. McCarthy and thought she was a good principal. Sure, she didn't push the teachers to bear down on students when test time came around, but she was otherwise a "right guy," so to speak. What moved me from anger to outrage was her replacement, Peter Gardener. He was the polar opposite, a big, straight arrow guy who thought it was his task to clean out the stables that McCarthy had left behind. He was brusque, narrow-minded and quickly aroused the contempt of students and faculty alike. But what could be done?

Three.

I was slamming my fingers down hard on the keys of my typewriter (remember, this was before everyone had a computer at home), muttering and cursing as I battled my way through another essay that my increasingly harried English teacher had assigned.

"Hate your typewriter then, do you?" said Uncle Mike, sticking his head in the door of my room. He stood there looking bemused, pausing now and then to take a sip of beer.

"Hate the new principal!" I replied. "He's got all the teachers piling on the homework so he can show the school board what a big man he is. It's all just for show. He's a dick!"

Mike smiled. "So Peter is a dick, eh? Well, I shouldn't wonder. A little taste of power, and getting his strings pulled by some hack piece-of-shit used car salesman, and here's the result. You waking me up at 3 a.m. from pounding on that ridiculous thing."

I shrugged. "Sorry. Can't be helped. I gotta do all this totally pointless busy work so that the new principal can show off about 'higher standards.' New broom sweeps clean. What a jerk."

That surprised my uncle. "Such fatalism from the Robin Hood of Brooksville High," he said, walking into my room and sitting on the bed. "I thought you were the self-appointed fair deal sheriff down there. What happened to your confidence, boy-o?"

Another shrug. "There's nothing I can do," I said, pausing in my typing. "Sure, I was able to push a few buttons with kids and such, but this is different. This is way out of my league. I'm just one skinny high school kid. They'd step on me like a bug."

"So what you're saying is you can't do it all by yourself, that you're no Superman," he said, paging idly through my American Lit book. "The Lone Ranger is outgunned and outflanked."

"Pretty much," I said, shoulders slumping. "I feel like I am letting Ms. McCarthy down."

I sighed and went back to my typing when the literature anthology, "Heritage of Liberty" flew through the air and smacked my in the side of the head. "Ow!" I said, a little shocked but not all that surprised. Uncle Mike liked to make his opening arguments non-verbally.

"You are, you little prick," he said, not meanly. "So you can't take these bastards Gardener and Bell all by yourself. Is the only way to solve a problem? A one-man charge? What's that old Simon and Garfunkel song, 'You Are a Schmuck, You Are An Island'."

"With all the asses you've saved at that sorry pile of bricks you call a 'high' school, you don't have any friends, any allies? It's just you and nobody else?" he asked. "Maybe you're not just letting that little tart of an ex-principal down; I think you're selling other people short, too!"

I rubbed the lump on my head and started to reflect on what he's said. Maybe I could try something if I could pull some people together, make a plan and pull off one last caper. The wheels in my mind began to whirr...

Four.

The creation of a revolt always starts with a few people. That's what I learned in history class. The Founding Fathers of the Brooksville Revolution actually featured as many Mothers as Fathers...

There was Hassam, who turned out to be a whiz with electronics, both video and audio. Amanda Powell worked in the front office of the school, and had access to all kinds of records and lists, as well as the switchboard. And Joanne Russell was the star of the girls' basketball team, and a minor campus celebrity.

And, of course, there was me, who wheedled a key to Mr. Gardener's office out of the thoroughly depressed Ellen McCarthy.

I held it up to my little cabal of co-conspirators and grinned. "Gentlemen and ladies at Brooksville High now in bed shall think themselves accursed they were not here, and hold their manhoods cheap, while any speaks that fought with us, upon..."  I looked at the calendar  "March 10th"!" I said, to mostly blank stares.

"It means that what we're about to do will forever be a legend in the history of Brooksville High. And here's what we do..."

With the cooperation of the school janitor, Mack, and with the key to the principal's office, our strike team of dedicated raiders began to set the trap. Hassam carefully shadowed the principal around campus, getting video and audio of him doing all manner of things useful to our purpose. We recorded his voice to the point where we had him saying almost any word you can think of, the better to string them together for our scheme. His salty language in some settings fit perfectly to what we had in mind.

We went into Gardener' s office several nights to shoot some video that would constitute the bulk of our operation. In that soundproof room, which the windows all blacked out, we created a little drama that would  we hope  grease the skids under our tyrannical principal once and for all.

"All right, Jack, Joanne," said Hassam. "I have all the preliminary footage and audio. My microphone will pick up Joanne's audio primarily; she will be recorded on her own track. Jack, you don't have to be completely silent, but don't yell, either. Please, both of you, remember to leave enough time between ... speeches ... to allow me to insert the other material. "Also, we need to create more footage than we'll probably need, just in case we spot a problem during post-production. So you'll have to ... act ... a bit longer than we expected.

"Jack, you are about the right size and shape, but to make the hair match, I need you to wear this wig. Try not to let it fall off. The image will not be sharp, but we don't want to complicate things by having your haircut fall off."

We all nodded. By the light of a floor lamp, the little play began and the camera began to whir.

"Miss Russell, I suppose you wonder why the principal would call you to his office in the middle of the day," I said, reading from the script we'd written.

"Yes, sir," said our basketball star-turned-lesbian thespian.

"I know you are headed towards a college scholarship for basketball. Very praiseworthy," I said. "But that scholarship is worth thousands of dollars; you're getting that and we're getting nothing."

"What do you mean?" asked Joanne, her voice the picture of wondering innocence.

"You've got a hot little body," I said. "I think considering how much this school has done for you, you need to do something for the school's principal."

"What?" she asked, as I strode across the room and  as the script called for  grabbed Joanne, pulled her close, and gave her a big wet kiss.

"Stop!" she play-acted with conviction. "What are you doing"?

I unzipped her sweater and pulled it open. "I'm doing whatever I want. This is my school and all you teasing twats belong to me!" I pulled open her bra and let loose her two firm, B-cup breasts.

"Stop! Stop this instant!" she cried, even though I could feel her nipples harden under my touch. "Please, somebody, help!!!"

I unbuttoned her jeans and peeled them off her legs, leaving her naked except for her panties. "Won't do you any good. No one can hear you. I had this room soundproofed so I could do whatever I wanted in here to you little sluts," I said.

Next step was for me to rip off her panties (they were an old pair) and throw her on the floor. She lay there shivering and pleading while I stripped off my own clothes, being careful not to disturb my false follicles.

"Stop that bitching," I said, drawing back a hand. In the deep light, I could see her mouthing the words: "Do it. Make it convincing. It's OK." So I somewhat reluctantly slapped her face.

"I told you to stop complaining, you dumb little bitch," I growled. "Now spread your legs and give me what you owe me," I added, mounting her  as I had done many times in our "friendship"  being a little rougher this time, for the camera.

She hammered her wrists against my chests and whispered in my ear, "You have to really sell it, Jack. C'mon ... let's see some real acting."

So I did. I rammed myself balls deep in her athletic cunt, and she arched her body in apparent agony, when indeed she was just clenching her pussy muscles around my turgid boyhood.

All for a very good cause, I slammed my cock powerfully into her, holding her down and at various times slapping her, pinching her tits and closing my hand around her throat. It was all play-acting, but in the final scene where I pinned her down by straddling her head and shooting a huge load of my sperm on her tear-streaked face, she later told me the act had sent a tingle all the way down to her clit that stayed lit the whole evening. To get enough footage, the script called for me, as principal, to fuck Joanne's mouth, pussy and asshole. "Poor" Joanne had to disguise her climaxes as shivers of revulsion as she took load after look of my sperm, felt my intrusive hands, mouth and fingers on and in her most private places.

"Please don't," she said for the microphone. "Don't cum in me, please! I was a virgin!" and "Oh God, help me! He's raping my poor little asshole" and "Please say you won't flunk me! I'll be good. Hurt me some more!"

"Just a few details to take care of," Amanda, as director, said, moving around the office to move this, and change that.

It took all night for Hassam to edit it all together, but when he did, it was a masterpiece. He managed to make it all look so believable, dubbing the principal's voice over my own remarks.

Right on schedule, during a second period class, Joanne felt ill and went to the nurse's office. She found scratch marks and bruises on the girl's body and face (good make-up work from Amanda!) and managed to get Joanne to "reluctantly confess" that she's been attacked, right here on campus. By whom? The nurse asked. Choking with theatrical tears, Joanne said "I can't tell! I can't! He'd make me lose my scholarship! I promised not to tell!"

The puzzle lasted two days until the UPS deliveryman brought a package addressed to the nurse. It contained a note, reading "Monsters like to keep souvenirs of their crimes. This bastard asked me to make duplicates for him. Get rid of him or the next dupe goes to the newspaper." The note was signed "A loyal Brooksville High alum" and was taped to a VHS cassette.

Our school's honest (and tenured) nurse watched (I like to imagine) with growing horror as the principal went to his office, took off his coat and received a student. In the low light of the room, some of the details were unclear, but this much was obvious. He was raping and abusing the school's star girls' basketball player, threatening to ruin her college chances if she didn't give in to his perverse desires.

We sent another tape and note to George Bell, which added this dig, "This the kind of guy you want to hang your political career on?"

A quick check of the records  ably assisted by student assistant Amanda Powell  showed that the principal had indeed called her into his office the day before her near-collapse. The "call slip," of course, had been manufactured by our little cabal. Hassam was able to duplicate Gardener's signature with amazing fidelity. "You could be a forger!" I said, admiringly. "Who do you think really wrote those excuse notes from my mother all through the semester?" replied Hassam.

Powell later overheard (well, she eavesdropped) on a phone conversation between Bell and Gardner in which a flabbergasted principal tried to deny everything. "Why would anyone make it up? Why would this girl do this?" asked the school board member. "I don't know," said Gardener. "I've seen her around campus, She is kind of a dog. She probably fantasized about sex and guys a lot, and this was her one chance to get a dick inside her." Bell almost exploded, yelling into the phone. "She's a lesbian, you idiot! Everybody on campus knows that! She's not interested in anybody's dick, you giant doofus!" (We had to smile when we heard that; Joanne punched me in the shoulder  OW  hard  when I smirked too boldly.)

Bell was livid. "I don't know what happened. I don't know whether you really did this, or whether you just pissed somebody off enough to monkey this up to make it look like you did," he ranted. "Do you know what this could mean?" "I could get arrested!" moaned Gardener. "Worse than that!" yelled Bell. "The scandal could ruin my political career! Everybody knows I pulled strings to get that dyke McCarthy out and get you in. And now you go and rape another dyke!"

"But I didn't do it," moaned Gardener. "You've got to believe me!" "Doesn't matter what I believe," said Bell, his voice becoming steely calm. "There's this videotape. And this damned honor student star athlete. And the nurse says she saw bruises on the chick. Who's gonna believe you over her?"

"But George" wailed the principal.

"But nothing. Your resignation is on my desk in one hour or this tape is going over to the police station. You can stay in town  in jail  or you can disappear and never be seen in Brooksville again. There's no third way."

And just like that ... the "reform" principal was gone, trailing a whiff of scandal behind him.

Five.

Bell was a jerk, but not a dumb one ... he sensed that Gardener had been set up, and was worried that whoever did that might decide to put him in their sights. He was a man with some "unusual" hobbies that would not bear much scrutiny.

Discretion being the better part of valor, he arranged for Ellen McCarthy to quietly reassume her former duties as principal of BHS. Her first official act was to pull me into her office, yank down my jeans and shorts, shimmy out of her panties and mount me. "I know ... Ohhhhhhhyessssss ... I know you somehow did this, Jackie," she said, moaning and wiggling her heated, slick cunny around my iron-hard teenage maleness. "I know you used that extra office key to do something to get that asshole Gardener out of here. I don't know what, but thank you!" She rode me like a banshee, back in the saddle again, so to speak, after three weeks of sitting and home and crying without any young firm flesh to feed on. "Now ... Yes ... Jackie, you nasty hot-balled bastard, fuck your mommy nice and hard! Slam it up into me! Breed my slut cunt! Mark me! Fuck your horny bitch of a principal! Empty those balls! Shoot your CUM DEEP IN ME! Please God, please fuck me HARDER!!!!!' Wow. If it was possible, she was even hornier than she was before. After squirting a thick morning load of boiling teenage seed deep in her climaxing cleft, my cock remained hard and she went back for a second helping.

"Damn," I muttered in her ear as she began to again impale herself on me with her wickedly suctioning vagina. "I figured after all of ... OH GOD ... this you'd kind of ... lie low!"

"NO!" she yelped, as if terrified by the thought. "I now know how easily this can be taken from me. I love to fuck and suck and be fucked and licked. I love it! I LOVE YOUR HARD, EAGER YOUNG COCK! I learned that I need to take as much of it as I can, while I can. That's what I learned."

She rode me for a while, moaning and rising and falling, I stayed hard while her tight cunt stripped up and down my meat. Amazingly, my mind drifted to MY lesson, what I had learned.

Confidence had brought me friends and pleasure and acceptance, but when the chips were really down, what I needed wasn't just faith in myself, but in the friends I made. That as successful as I was, I could never really make the world I wanted without people I loved, respected and trusted. That's a pretty grown-up thought for a teenage boy with his smoking throbbing meat being ridden by a moaning, spasming middle-aged school administrator. But my last thought just before everything when into fireworks in my brain and gunpowder exploding between my legs was that good people around you can make you better than you ever thought possible.

I also learned what "fulcrum" meant. It's amazing what vocabulary you pick up if you just embrace your ... education.

This is the concluding chapter of "Confidence Man." Thanks to all the people who asked me to finish it. thanks to all of you who had the patience to wait. Your comments and encouragement are appreciated. Anyone think there's more to tell about Jack and his friends? Do we need a "Confidence Man 2" or is this enough?
