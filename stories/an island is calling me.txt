Date of first publication Thursday PM, March 22, 2001:

It is an indescribable feeling; knowing the plane you are flying is going down and you are helpless to do anything about it. The controls react slowly as I wait for the plane to make contact with the sea or ground, lightning and the sounds of thunder penetrate the heavy rain. There is a tremendous thud, then blackness.

How did I get into the situation? Actually it is quite a story. First a little about myself, my name is Don Parsons. I am a computer software developer by trade; however, my specialty is computer viruses, the removal of them. My firm contracts me out to various clients all over the world. For this I am very well remunerated, plus a very generous expense account and the firm's clients usually pay bonuses. I do good work.

I am fifty-one, a widower, living alone in a rambling house in Abbotsville, a small city in the northeast. My children are long gone, both living on the West Coast. During my military service I was trained as a pilot, nothing fancy just cargo planes.

For that reason, I am going down with this plane!

My current client is a large hotel complex on a Caribbean Island. Now that the assignment is complete I decide to stay for a couple of days to unwind enjoying the large sandy beaches and maybe a little fishing. During the assignment I got to know the hotel manager/owner and his daughter. Mr. Raven is a very friendly outgoing man, very good at his job. His daughter didn't follow in daddy's footsteps. She is a spoiled little bitch. If I had been her dad, I would have warmed her bottom numerous times during my stay. My guess, she is twelve or thirteen. She is a very attractive, with a body men would kill to be close to and has full pouty lips, usually coated with a deep red lipstick that sets off her beautiful coffee colored complexion. But her attitude is the shits to put it mildly. She is a demanding witch. But in her father's mind she could do no wrong.

During my many conversations with Mr. Raven, he learned I am a pilot; fully qualified to handle his cargo plane. He made me a proposition I couldn't refuse. Fly his transport to one of his outer island resorts with their weekly supplies; pick up his regular pilot who is just completing his vacation with his family. For two hours of my time the pay is a two-week all expenses paid stay at one his hotels plus two return flights from the States. It should have been a walk in the park.

The cargo was a large collection of supplies and foodstuffs for the hotel. My time was spent carefully watching as they load the plane. It is something learned very early in my flying career: you make sure your load is balanced and secured in place. Many a military pilot experienced trouble because of an unbalanced or unsecured load. After the cases of supplies, the new mattresses and soft goods were loaded on top and secured. That is when I rechecked all the securing lines to make sure the cargo nets were anchored properly.

Another perk for my trouble is that Mr. Raven has arranged a fishing charter for me at the island complex. This is on top of the two weeks stay, plus I am being very well paid. What could happen to screw up this well laid plan?

Pre-packing my remaining luggage, I store it at the hotel as my flight home is leaving two hours after my return from the island. So it is just a matter of transferring my luggage to the States-bound plane. The timing is perfect.

The day before I am scheduled to leave Mr. Raven has a surprise for me.

"Don, I need to ask you a favor."

"Well, if it is within my power, I will be glad to help."

"Leeza's aunt Lucy is the manager of the island complex. She would like Leeza to visit for a couple of weeks. Would you mind if she joins you on the trip?"

What was to be a welcome respite at a fisherman's paradise has now taken on the anticipation of a double root canal. How in the hell can I can tell Mr. Raven how much I loathe his whiny bitch of a daughter; although I think he suspects. Suddenly, I am getting a real shitty feeling about this flight.

"I would be glad to help."

What the hell can I say?

"I can assure you she will be good. I have already talked to her. I know how you feel about her."

Very astute of you Mr. Raven, that thought is running through my mind. What else can go wrong? This morning three more bags are loaded which I make sure are secure. Leeza greets me with a sullen glare and climbs into the co-pilot's seat. Her short shorts and tube top did nothing for my foul mood. I am ready to bite her head off if she as much as moves the wrong way. But when you think the situation can't get any worse I am handed a current weather report. There is a topical storm brewing with very high winds and all kinds of nasty things if we were to get caught in it.

"You should have nothing to worry about. The storm is nearly five hours away and you should be sitting safely in the bar when it hits. The hotel crew will tie down the plane as soon as you land. I don't take any chances with my plane."

I can remember wondering if the storm can tell time and is aware it isn't supposed to hit for five hours. My mood isn't improving. Finally we are in position to take off. The engines are purring as I survey the gauges. Everything is in order. Next is my mental preflight check, something I did automatically every time in a pilot seat. This plane is well maintained. One final check of the  gauges confirms we are ready for take off. The chocks are pulled.

The plane surges forward fighting the brakes; the powerful engines whine with fury; then the brakes are released. The take-off is flawless. Once leveling off I look at Leeza. She has been quiet so far. The adrenalin rush of the take-off has my other senses numb until the plane is stable. Now Leeza's scent hits me like a hammer. I do love the smell of a woman. The cool air has a positive effect on her nipples. They are large and long. Her legs are spread and her pubes are outlined in her shorts. She is wearing long dangly earrings that keep drawing my attention to her beautiful face, she may be a bitch, but she is a beautiful bitch.

"You don't like me do you?"

"What makes you say that?"

"My dad gave me an ultimatum to be a lady or stay home. What have I done to you?"

"I don't think you can face the truth. Let's drop it. We only have to be together for two hours."

The tone of my voice more than suggests I am not interested in expanding my reasons. Leeza remains quiet staring out at the ocean. The blue sky at this height is pure color, there are no clouds. All the gauges report all things mechanical are operating as they should. My mind is on the charter fishing I will be enjoying during my stay. The flight is on course. If the truth is told, it is actually monotonous flying over the large expanse of the ocean. All you can see is rolling waves.

About an hour into the trip I feel the plane shudder. We hit an air pocket causing the plane to dive; the plane seems to be fighting my control. A hellish looking dark blue cloud seems to have come out of nowhere. As the plane recovers from the dive; heavy rain starts pelting the fuselage. It is now obvious the storm that is supposed to be five hours away isn't. We have flown into it. It's like someone threw a blanket over the plane. Lightening is everywhere, each flash accompanied by a loud crash of thunder. The gauges are going nuts. The compass needle is circling. The storm has caused magnetic interference. Leeza screams.

"What is happening? Are we ok?"

"I am not sure. Make sure your seat belt is tight. Hang on to something solid, it is going to get rough."

That comment turns out to be an understatement. The plane is not responding well to the controls in spite of my attempts. We are drifting from side to side with the occasionally sharp dip. Since the compass is out I have no idea if we are on course; even if we were, we can't see a thing but sheets of rain. We are flying blind. The left engine starts to misfire. All my coaxing doesn't change anything, finally it quits. I feather that propeller. Increasing the power to the remaining engine to maximum, I make a silent prayer. However, it is not enough as I can sense we are losing altitude. Hell, we are going down; the big question is where. I flip on the emergency homing beacon. It will send a beep until the battery gives out. Then I begin calling Mayday into the microphone, however the static is so bad I doubt the call is heard by anyone.

"Leeza, we are going to crash. I have no idea where we are. If we hit the water hopefully what is left of the plane will float giving us enough time to get a life-raft inflated."

The next thing I feel is the fuselage hitting something solid we are hurled forward against the belts and then everything goes black.

When I regain consciousness; the sun is shining, the sound of waves hitting a beach is in the background. Leeza appears to be okay and is staring at me.

"I thought you were dead. I tried to wake you but your body just flopped around when I shook you. Your head is bleeding."

My forehead hurts when it's touched. There is a bruise the size of an egg and it is oozing blood, it is nothing life threatening. After looking behind me, I am thankful that the cargo nets were secure. They held all the cargo in place; otherwise we may have been crushed.

"Leeza, let's get out and see where we are and what damage there is to the plane."

When we depart the plane or should I say what is left of the plane we can see the damage is extensive. We must have hit the sea before the body of the plane hit the shore. The sheer force drove the fuselage up the beach and to the tree line. The wings and engines have been torn off; however, the body of the plane appears still intact. We are on an island somewhere on the vast ocean. The beach is beautiful, all white sand with the waves slowly rolling up to the shore. It must have been one hellva storm. Some of the palm trees are snapped like they were matchsticks.

"How are you Leeza? Are you hurt?"

"No, just bruised. All I can remember is that when we hit I was thrown against the belts and then must have passed out. I have been waiting for a couple of hours for you to wake up. I was so relieved to see you were breathing. At first I though you were dead. I started to panic, but then I saw your chest move. I am so glad you are ok."

"Well, let's see if the radio still works."

Climbing back into the cockpit confirms my suspicions; the radio is in shambles. The battery compartment is leaking acid. All four casings are cracked. There is no power left in the system.

"Leeza the radio is shot and to make matters worse the beacon has stopped transmitting. I hope search and rescue is able to find us. I have no idea where we are or how badly we were blown off course. The first thing we have to do is find water. Then we will walk the shore to see if there are others on the island."

I was going to go inland, however I decide to go through the cargo manifest first. Fortunately, the body of the plane is fairly level. The way it is buried in the sand it will not move and will do us for cover and living quarters. Reviewing the manifest, we are carrying all kinds of foodstuffs and eight cases of fancy bottled water. All we have to do is find them. My hope is they are not glass. Releasing the cargo nets allows the boxes to fall forward. It appears we won't starve to death as long as we can find a can opener. The cardboard cases of water are all smashed, but fortunately, the bottles are all plastic and have survived the crash. All our immediate needs have been taken care of. The manifest lists a box of new utensils for the hotel. I search the pile to find it; hoping that someone had ordered a new can opener. Locating the case, I drag it outside and search. Well, if we have guests we are set. We have table settings for fifty guests and most pieces have survived. There is a can opener, numerous sizes of kitchen knives, large spoons, etc. Opening one of the cases of food we find that we are having oysters for breakfast.

"Here is breakfast, Leeza. We will sort through the cargo later. I want to walk around the shore; hopefully we will find we are not alone."

You know, oysters aren't that bad for breakfast. However, I would have eaten anything at this point. In the ocean I wash my forehead removing the crusted blood. The water feels cool and refreshing. I am sure there will be fish just off shore. Maybe it won't be necessary to catch any, but my hopes for a quick rescue are not good, especially if we are way off course.

"Ok Leeza lets start exploring."

We both remove our shoes and start walking down the beach. The theory being if this is an island, which I have no doubt, we will eventually end up back here. I have emptied my overnight bag and packed four bottles of water. The second hand on my watch is still moving so at least we have the time. It is ten thirty when we start out. It takes us three hours to walk around the island. There is evidence that others have been here, but there is nothing permanent and no one else is here. As we approach the plane from the opposite direction we find a small stream of fresh water draining into the ocean. There is a spring on the island.

"It appears we may to be here for some time. The first thing we have to do is organize the mess in the plane; then set up sleeping arrangements for tonight. We can explore the inland tomorrow. I want to gather a large pile of dry wood for a fire pyre if we hear a plane. Hopefully, the smoke can be seen for miles."

Leeza nods her head. Still dressed in her sexy outfit, although a bit ruffled, I have to admit she radiates beauty. There is an old adage, 'Circumstance makes strange bedfellows.' It has me wondering if she is still a virgin, but only for a moment. What a stupid thought considering our situation. We have a lot to do before nightfall. Working side by side cleaning up the cargo area, it doesn't take long to get some order. We stack all the canned goods. Two large palms near the plane shade our water supply. The theory is to keep it as cool as possible. Finally, all is organized. Stacking two sets of mattresses three high for beds with one mattress in between them will provide some semblance of privacy. A large chunk of metal from the wing makes a lean-to against the plane. We both are sweating.

"Don, I stink. I need to clean up."

"We have done enough for one day. There is a case of soap and shampoo. You can bathe in the ocean, but you will have to rinse off the salt in fresh water. The stream will be cool. I will try and rig something up tomorrow to have a supply of warmer fresh water. While you are bathing, I will follow the stream inland; it may lead to a pool."

"Ok. But don't go too far. I don't like being alone."

She gathers up the shampoo and soap. Looking towards the shore, Leeza starts removing her top. This could prove interesting; unfortunately my conscience gets the better of me and I head inland. There are a number of trees bearing different kinds of fruit, but I have no idea what they are. Sampling the water, it is ice cold and with no apparent taste. Privately, I smile thinking of Leeza rinsing the salty ocean water in this ice water. Then I hear a scream.

I race out of the bush toward Leeza. She is on shore naked screaming while stomping her feet.

"What is wrong?"

"There is something in the water. See?"

When I look I see three odd looking fish. It appears they are curious to see who else is in the water. When I walk into the water they swim towards me and pull the hairs on my legs. They appear harmless.

"Leeza those fish were just curious and touched you when you were in the water. They don't appear dangerous. Look they are after my leg hair."

Turning, I gaze at Leeza's naked body. She is beautiful. Her body is well proportioned for her height. Her breasts are the size of half oranges topped with sizable nipples. Her luv lips are full, at least the small part exposed from this angle. The mat of black curly hair is trimmed in a shape of a heart. My spear reacts. My desire for her as a woman heightens, but then reality sets in; she is only a child. Embarrassed, I redirect my gaze.

"Leeza, you better get something on."

"I still need to rinse in the stream."

"Ok, I will turn my head."

As she starts walking towards the stream; my curiosity gets the better of me. From the rear she is as well developed as from the front. Her bum gently sways as she walks; true beauty in motion; too bad she is such a bitch. She has long well-shaped legs with magnificent calf muscles. For one so young she is very appealing. Stopping, she dips then pours the cold water over her body and gives out a shriek when the cold water hits.

Making my retreat, I am at the plane when she reappears wearing a thong bikini. I don't know which is more arousing, seeing her naked or in her bikini. A knowing smile spreads as she looks at me.

"I notice you found something you must like about me."

"Leeza, maybe we should start from scratch. I have no idea how long we will be marooned on this island, but I think a fresh start is in order."

She looks at me with her shining brown bedroom eyes. She is glowing with confidence.

"Yes, I agree. I will try my best to act like a mature woman. I may drift off occasionally, but I am sure you will remind me to come back to reality. I think my dad spoiled me."

I start to laugh and she joins me.

"Hello Leeza, my name is Don. It is a pleasure to meet you."

"The pleasure is all mine."

The heat of my blush starts at my toes. It has me wondering about her scream; is the witch playing me. Is she aware of the wiles of a woman and how men are suckers for a damsel in distress? It is something to think about.

"Leeza, we have to talk about our situation. I have no idea if our SOS was heard, we have to face the fact we may be here for a while."

"Yes, I was thinking about the same thing. We have food and water to do us for a while?"

"Yes. There are fish and fruits of some kind growing in the jungle. Maybe you will have a better idea what it is. I have fishing tackle with me. If everything had gone well I would have been on the charter your dad arranged for me right now. I will try some casting this afternoon."

My attention is focused on her lush body. Why couldn't I been marooned with an eighteen year old instead of this young jailbait? That is very selfish thought.

"How old are you, Leeza?"

"I will be thirteen next month. Daddy has a big party planned for me as I enter my teen years. How old are you?"

"I am fifty one going on thirty-nine. We will have to make the best of our situation. Let's start fresh."

"Good."

Leeza holds her hand out, a peace offering. Touching her skin brings thoughts that should remain subdued, she feels so soft and appealing. Just the thought of the possibility of hugging and kissing her has me trembling, Don get real. She grasps me, pulling her self into my arms.

"Hold me, Don. I am really scared."

My arms circle her. Her body is so soft and so warm. My hands travel up and down her back then lower cupping her lovely bottom. Her face is buried into my neck. I couldn't help myself kissing the top of her head enjoying the gorgeous scent of shampoo and soap. My caresses bring a moaning response. Leeza snuggles into my body pushing against my growing erection.

"There is no reason to be scared. Your dad will have search parties looking for us. I am sure we will be rescued soon."

Of that I have no doubt, but in the event we are here longer than planned; we have to make sure we are prepared. Leeza breaks the hug and looks into my eyes. Her big bedroom eyes are moist as she is near crying. A kiss on her nose brings a smile to her face.

"Let's see what we are going to have for supper. Would you like fresh fish?"

"What fresh fish?"

"The one I am going to catch."

Once my tackle is set up with a lure that has never let me down yet, I try casting into the waves. The first two casts result in two long pieces of seaweed. I can hear Leeza giggling behind me. At least my actions accomplishes something; taking her mind off her fears. The third cast is a winner. I feel the fish hit and tear off into deeper water, the reel's clutch screaming as the line is released. Giving the rod a strong tug to make sure my hook is set; the battle begins. Slowly I start to make ground; pulling my prey in faster than losing line off the reel. It takes a good twenty minutes before we see a good-sized fish being dragged ashore.

Once on shore there is the kill. Moving it to where the stream enters the ocean it is cleaned and filleted into four large pieces. Now the question is; how are we going to cook it.

"Leeza, did you see a frying pan or cooking oil in the cargo?"

"Yes, there is some sort of pan and a large container of olive oil."

Scrounging around in the lean-to I find both. The fish is wrapped in a large leaf waiting to be fried. After gathering stones to make a fire pit; in minutes we have a fire blazing. The island has an abundant supply of firewood lining the shore. We both are hungry and the frying fish looks and smell appetizing.

Resourceful Leeza locates plates and cutlery. She also holds up containers of salt and pepper. Tomorrow we will have to take a more detailed inventory of what we actually have. Opening a can of peas we now have a vegetable with our fish dinner. Surprisingly it tastes great, likely the result of hunger, rather than my cooking skills. Leeza volunteers to do the dishes while I take an ocean bath. All the activities of the day have me smelling like an armpit.

Stripping, I gather soap and then enter the water. It feels good to remove the dirt of the day. Then, looking towards our encampment I realize Leeza is watching every move I am making. Just the thought of her scrutinizing me has my cock extended to the max. No point in covering up now, then she really shocks me as she walks towards me. She seems totally enthralled at my nakedness and my cock. It isn't anything out of the ordinary.

"This is the first time I have seen one other than in pictures. Can I touch it?"

What a question to ask a guy who is hurting just imagining her doing exactly that. Never in my life have I even entertained a sexual notion for anyone so young. She is still a preteen and I am looking at her as a potential lover. Hell, I want her.

"You realize this is something that is taboo. You are underage and if I were to do this on the mainland I would be castrated and classified as a pervert."

"Don, I am not going to tell anyone beside there is nobody else within hundreds of miles. I just want to feel you. It looks so neat."

My raging hardon is something she thinks looks neat. Thankfully, she can't read my mind; or she may not think it is so neat. My tool isn't the biggest. At just under seven inches with a five-inch girth, it has served me well.

"Well, if you want to you can touch it."

Leeza approaches me slowly; her searing fingers try to encircle me. Her grip feels so good; the desire to start humping is strong, but I restrain myself. She inspects every inch moving the foreskin from its head. She looks in bewilderment at my sack.

"That holds my testicles."

"Testicles?"

"Yes, a more common term is balls."

"What are they for?"

"That is where sperm is produced to make babies."

"Ok, now I know what you mean. We read about it in class. They feel so warm."

Leeza continues to feel my sack; finding the two very sore balls that she massages gently. All of this touching is not helping me. It really has me hurting. Then encircling my shaft she starts stroking; watching the action of my foreskin. You know what is going to happen next. My hips automatically start pumping in her hands, what a sensation.

"Leeza, you shouldn't be doing that?"

"Why not?"

"If you keep it up you will see."

She seems fascinated by the feel and the fact that something is going to happen. She strokes and I pump. Holding off is no longer an option; as strings of cum ejaculates hitting the sand at her feet.

"What happened?"

"You made me climax. It feels so good; but I shouldn't have let it go this far."

"What was that white stuff?"

"It is called cum, it is actually sperm. If shot inside of you when you are fertile it would make you pregnant."

"You mean that big thing is supposed to go inside of me? How?"

How the hell did we get here, doesn't she know about the birds and the bees.

"Oh, your body cavity will stretch to accommodate it. You know were babies come from? Well, you have to stretch a lot more than this 'thing' to deliver a baby."

She is trying to imagine a baby coming out of her. Leeza had a look of astonishment on her face.

"I never thought of it that way. Do you think that will fit in me?"

Oh, if only she only knew how much I would love to try. Unfortunately, my recuperating powers are not what they used to be, or we could have our first lesson. Her bikini thong is damp at her pubes. All this talk about sex has her aroused also.

"Well, I am not sure, likely if you were excited enough it would go in. Have you had your periods yet?"

"Yes, for nearly a year. I just finished last week."

"That means you could be fertile shortly. I don't suppose you are on birth control pills."

Now that is wishful thinking on my part.

"I don't think so; but I do take pills to regulate my periods. I take one every day."

Birth control pills are commonly used to regulate cycles. There are all kinds of possibilities. Perhaps she will allow me to examine the pills when we get back to the plane. The hand job has certainly taken the edge off of my problem. Humm, would she consider doing that job daily? What it would be like to get a blowjob from her? What a thought! It is late in the day and we are pooped. We have done a lot and the excitement has finally caught up with me, not to mention the wonderful feeling of her hand-job.

"Leeza, it has been a long day. Tomorrow we will build a fire pyre to be ready in the event we hear a plane. The smoke should draw attention of the searchers."

Following me to the plane, we get ready for bed. The bed set up furthest from the door is for her, she settles down.

"Good night Don."

"Good night Leeza."

Watching as the last inklings of daylight fade to welcome the night; soon stars fill the sky. Looking out the window reveals a beautiful scene. What really gets me is the silence. The only sound is the waves as they roll softly to the shore. It soon has me lulled to sleep.

Sometime during the night as slight movement has me realize I am not alone in bed. Leeza is lying beside me nude. She has snuggled right into the crook of my body spoon fashion. Encircling her body has me grasping one of her breasts. The nipple is hard. At first I am ashamed of my actions, but then recall this young lady has already given me a hand job. With my face buried in Leeza's hair my mind drifts off into a beautiful dream; she is the prime character.

My hand is still cupping her breast in the morning as she sleeps. For whatever reason she rolls over now lying on her back. My eyes devour the scene before me starting with her beautiful face, those fantastic lips, to her soft breasts down to her black mat above heaven. My loins are stirring. Watching as her eyes open she looks and a warm smile appears.

"Good morning, Leeza. I trust you had a good sleep?"

"Oh yes, it feels good bare skin to bare skin. You are so warm."

She stretches causing her breasts to tighten. Her dark brown nipples stand out. She extends her legs then brings in her knees spreading her thighs enough so I can see the top of heaven. It is hard for me to believe she is only twelve; a twelve year old with a body of an eighteen-year-old. I am impressed as my cock will attest.

With that her arms are around my neck and we kiss the kiss of all kisses. The energy transfer between us is fantastic. When I roll onto my back I pull her on top of me. My engorged erection is between her legs rubbing heaven. My hands are running up and down the smooth soft skin of her back and bum. I feel like a teenager on a first date. My adrenalin is pumping. This is a first for me. Young girls never interested me in the past; however being this close to Leeza changes that. As she moves her body I can feel the moisture from her pussy lathering my hard cock. Then we break the kiss.

"What would you like to do today?"

"Well, you mentioned building a pyre so we can signal any search planes and then we can inventory our supplies. After that we can explore the interior of the island."

"Sounds like a plan. Let's have breakfast. What culinary delights await us?"

Not bothering to dress I search in the foodstuffs. There really isn't much breakfast fare so I settle on a can of peaches. After splitting the contents I hand a bowl to Leeza. Much to my delight she follows my example; remaining naked. She sits across from me and prepares to eat. However, she crosses one leg over the other; giving me the view of her lovely pussy opened wide, exposing the soft pink interior. Her inner lips are coated with drops of her dew. The pink button of her clitoris is out of its hood. If this is to get my attention, she is successful. She must notice how extended my cock is. A dip in the cool ocean should take care of my malady; but maybe Leeza will volunteer to help my problem.

An Island Is Calling Me

Continuation...

After breakfast Leeza takes the dishes to the stream to wash in the sand and I scour the shore for dry wood. The area proves bountiful. The pyre stands four feet high. Making a ball of dry grass and tying it to a stick for an igniter, we stuff the bottom of the pyre with more dry grass; a lighter protected in a plastic bag finishes the project. We are ready.

"It should do the job. If we hear a plane engine I will light the pyre and you can get some leafy branches to produce smoke."

"Sounds like a team effort. Let's go exploring."

"First, do you have the pills that regulate your periods?"

"Yes, I have a three month supply. Why?"

"Could I see the box?"

Leeza disappears into the plane and comes back holding a plastic wafer of pills. They are still in their original pharmacy box with all the literature. After reading all the material it confirms they are also birth control pills.

"Are you satisfied?"

"Yes."

Both of us put on sneakers to walk in the bush. Fortunately, there is little underbrush so we can remain naked. It is to bad Leeza isn't leading, as I would love to view her naked body. We follow the stream inland. While walking all kinds of birds fill the trees squawking as we disturb their tranquility. Some are quite large. I wonder if there is a possibility of eggs.

We continue our trek for about twenty minutes and come to a clearing. It is beautiful. There is a small pool and the water is so clear you can see the bottom. The stream that feeds it comes from deeper in the interior of the island. The area has the same white sand as the beach with the exception of one small portion that is covered with a soft moss. The shallow part of the pool is actually warm. I test it with my feet, walking towards the center then I swim. It feels great. The water is fresh so we won't have to worry about salt build-up on our skin. Leeza is splashing behind me. Waiting for her to join me, the natural thing to do is to grab her and kiss. She returns the kiss using her tongue. My one hand is between her legs. It is the first time touching her pussy. Her legs encircle me spreading her luv lips. My whole body is pounding with excitement as I explore between her legs. With one hand supporting her body I walk towards the moss on the shore. With Leeza on her back and her legs spread she raises her arms beckoning me. Kneeling before her I pay homage to her beauty. The water is slowly dripping off her body with a small stream running between her luv lips. It is just too much for me, leaning down to kiss and lick. Her musky odor is an additional aphrodisiac. Drinking from the fountain of love; Leeza moans; her body trembling. Her hands grasp the back of my head pulling me deeper into heaven. Continuing to lick and suck, my mouth finds her clitoris; Leeza's body stiffens; then arches for a climax. Looking up to her facial expression it suggests she is in a far off place.

"Don, what happened? I have never felt anything like that. What did you do to me? I feel so good. Can we do it again?"

"You just experienced your first oral climax. Yes, we will do it again many times."

Propping myself up on my elbow studying the beauty before me, Leeza's luv lips are full and puffy. A heavy stream of her cream slowly works it way towards her rosebud; leaning forward tonguing her, her taste is addictive. If nothing else happens it will be a pleasure eating Leeza. The flow seems endless. Kissing her luv lips my finger explores every facet. She watches each move. My finger actually touches a barrier. Leeza looks at me inquisitively.

"That is your hymen. Could you feel my finger push against it?"

"Yes. It feels different, nice but different. Do you think you can fit in me?"

"I certainly hope so. Are you game?"

Leeza smiles; nodding her head in agreement. Positioning my body above her with my spear pointing at heaven, the head is at the entrance. Slowly entering her: resistance is instant. Leeza reacts unexpectedly by forcing her hips upward. With the barrier broken my cock easily slips deep into her. There is a look of shock and surprise on her face.

"It feels like something is trying to split me in half."

"You are too tense; let your body accept it. It should feel better shortly."

The slow movement of my hips enhances the feeling. Her tightness grips me like a vise. It is breathtaking being deep in heaven. Each stroke has me quivering with excitement. I never thought being with one so young could feel so passionate. Leeza's breathing is ragged.

"How are you doing?"

"Good. I have never felt anything like it. I am shaking all over. The feeling between my legs has never been so intense."

Her body stiffens as she experiences her first vaginal climax. Her sounds range from a scream to a moan. She seems to hold her breath forever, then there is a sigh and her body goes limp.

"What a wild feeling. It is like when you licked me except stronger. I have never experienced anything like it before. Will it happen again?"

"It should as long as I can hold off cumming."

"You are going to shoot white stuff into me?"

"Yes. You should be able to feel it. The best thing that could happen is we both cum at the same time."

Closing my eyes to enjoy the intense feeling we continue to pump. Leeza's vaginal muscles contract before she cums. The pressure is on me to hold off till then. Leeza's breathing is now erratic; she must be near her point of no return. Her hips intuitively push upwards meeting my thrusts, then she gives a very strong moan, it is my sign. Everything seems to let go, surge after surge of cum flows out of me. It is one of the strongest climaxes I've had in years. My relief is immediate. Collapsing on top of Leeza, we roll, still joined at the hips, ending with her on top. Slowly she comes down from the height of heights.

"I have never felt anything so beautiful. Is that what sex is all about?"

"That is just part of it. Mind you, it is one of the better parts."

"I feel so good. I just want to curl up and have a nap."

"It isn't that we don't have the time. We can explore later in the day."

Leeza spoon curls into my body and snuggles tight to me. Sleep overtakes us both. When we finally wake nearly two hours have past.

"How do you feel?"

"Like a log has been between my legs. I never would have believed you could get that monster in me. Can we do it again?"

"Of that I have no doubt, but later. However, let's get cleaned up and continue our trip inland. Do you want to go back and get some clothes?"

"Do you?"

"No. I love looking at you naked. You are beautiful."

"Thank you, Don. You don't look so bad yourself. Let's clean up and continue."

We both hit the pool. My proud spear is now just a small shriveled-up stub. As I watch Leeza cleans cum from between her legs. I can feel new life. The bitch has proven to be one hellva young lady and now a lover.

"Don, I am bleeding."

"You will for a bit. We ruptured your hymen. It should stop shortly, next time you will enjoy it even more."

"And you?"

"Leeza, you were wonderful. It feels good when I am in you."

"And I like you in me. Let's go."

Leeza leads this time. As I thought, she is quite a view from behind. Her hips are very well shaped into her hourglass figure. Her body can only improve with age. We follow the stream for an hour. There are signs that we are not the first ones here. I found a bit of cloth buried in the sand. There is no way of telling how old it is. Finally, we enter a clearing. There is evidence of a fire pit. Someone has used this site in the past. There are bones in the pit, like a small rib cage. Are there food animals in the forest. Leeza finds a fruit tree. She picks two pieces and hands me one.

"I don't know what they are, but we serve them at the hotel."

It has a sweet tangy flavor. There are numerous trees in the area bearing this fruit. We will never go hungry. It appears that the former adventurers had stayed here for sometime. They had built an oven out of clay. It reminds me of an old bread oven of our forefathers I had seen in a pioneer village. I wondered what they had to bake. Then I realize it is late. We have been gone from the plane for nearly five hours. We will come back here tomorrow and see if we can find anything that we can use.

The trek back seems a lot shorter. Every time I look at Leeza I am reminded of the delight at the pool. Tonight will be more of the same. Leeza is looking at me smiling.

"Well, we can get along. We found something that we have in common, we both like sex. I feel like I want to do it again right now."

"First we eat, then we get everything cleaned up and ready for tomorrow, then we do what you would like."

Supper is another surprise. We have more oysters, this time with cream corn. It reminds me again to make sure we inventory the supplies. There must be more than oysters. Our exercise and lovemaking sharpened our appetites as we devour the meal. After the meal we both wash the dishes in the stream.

"Don, do we have enough daylight to go to the pool and bathe?"

"Yes. I think we have about an hour before the sun actually goes down. Do you want to go back to the pool?"

"Yes. We can bathe each other. Hand in hand we slowly walk back to the pool. It is so quiet; the only thing you can hear is the buzzing of the insects. The pool is like a mirror. Leeza has me sit down and starts to bathe me. The water is so soft just a little soap creates piles of soapy lather. Her hands are all over my upper body. The warm water and her massaging feels so relaxing. Leeza takes great pleasure in washing my hair. Gobs of lather are floating down my face and I start to sneeze when it covers my nose. I can hear her giggling. Then she has me stand up. Slowly she lathers my buttocks and rinses me. Then she takes the longest time cleaning my erection. She is at eye level and studies every aspect of my equipment. She rolls the foreskin back numerous times, lathering and re-lathering.

"Don, I like the way this feels. It is so interesting. I like it when it sticks out like this."

"Well, if you keep it up it won't be sticking out. If you want to feel it inside your body stop what you are doing. I will bathe you now."

We change positions. I am kneeling, enjoying being close to her heaven. The rest of Leeza's body has to come first. Using the shampoo generously, suds cascade down her body. This time it is she that starts to snort and blow as the suds cover her mouth and nose.

"See, you don't like it either. What is good for me; is good for you."

It is a pleasure to examine her body. Her breasts are fascinating. Leeza's nipples are extended and hard. After carefully washing each one and then rinsing, I plant a kiss on each of them. Making love to Leeza tonight will be long and slow. I made her turn around, her bottom is wall shaped and padded. Spreading her cheeks I examine a beautiful rose bud. It is smooth and tight, but it feels wonderful. I couldn't help myself my tongue flicks it numerous times.

"Don, what are you doing?"

"Tasting you, don't you like it?"

"Oh, I do. But don't you think that is bad?"

"Did you think it was bad when I tasted you this afternoon?"

"Oh no, it made me tingle all over. I couldn't believe you put you tongue on my tizzy."

"Your tizzy?"

"You know smarty, the place between my legs. It felt so good. Before today, I couldn't imagine anyone kissing me there."

"Well, you taste great. I want to do it again tonight before we go to sleep."

"Please. I like it. Can I lick you?"

My cock reacted with that comment. Standing straight out from my body in effect saying please help yourself.

"Leeza, I would like that."

Turning Leeza to face me I wash her legs leaving only heaven to complete. The nearness of her pussy allows me to enjoy her animal scent. Her puffy lips show evidence of our love making from this morning. Gently lathering her three times and then rinsing, we are done. But before I let her go, I French kiss her between her legs. Leeza moans with desire.

"Don, let's get back to the plane. I want you to do that again when I am lying down."

As we return to the plane the sun is sinking into the ocean. One good thing about this island is the beauty of the scenery. Fortunately, there is enough of a breeze coming off the ocean that flies are not a problem. The interior of the plane is cool. There is no pretence tonight. Leeza and I are in the same bed. My body dwarfs her. Leeza is about four foot seven. I am six foot one. With her lying beside me we kiss and feel our tongues touch. Moving downwards, my mouth latches onto one of her lovely nipples. It has a distinct flavor. Leeza's hands are on the back of my head pulling me to her breast, moving me from one to the other, sighing with pleasure. It wouldn't take much for me to fall asleep with one of her soothers. My hands are exploring her bottom and fingering her brown star. Her body reacts by pushing against my finger.

Leeza is now gently nudging my head downward, needing more stimulation. Letting go of her nipple; my next stop is at her bellybutton; then on to heaven. Her musky odor acts as an aphrodisiac, like I need one. Large drops of delicious dew form on the outer luv lips. Burying my face in this pool of love; my eyes are closed as my tongue finds Leeza's clitoris peeking out of its hood, demanding attention. Sucking and licking Leeza rewards me with a soft moan and a squirming body. Her thick creamy juice tastes incredible. Unlike this morning, the pace is much slower now. I haven't felt this relaxed in ages. Leeza's body trembles with climax after climax. Her thighs squeeze my head; it is the last thing I remember as sleep overtakes me.

Waking in the morning, my face is still at Leeza's clitoris, my ears still flattened from the pressure of her thighs. She is still sleeping. Disentangling myself, I can feel a dried crust that covers most of my lower face, the result of surplus juice. A quick trip to the stream cleans and refreshes; some shampoo removes the remnants from my hair. Back in the plane, Leeza's sexual odor is prevalent, my cock reacts; loaded for bear, but relief will have to wait.

The first thing on the agenda is to get a pair of shorts from my luggage. Then ruffle through the foodstuffs. I am ecstatic when cases of coffee and canned milk are uncovered. In my rush to get the cases out of the plane I never looked at the contents; that will be rectified today as there may be other hidden treasures. With coffee pot in hand I head for the fire pit. It has only been a few days without coffee, but is seems like a year. The aroma is like finding an old friend.

In this situation what could be better than sitting on a log watching the waves slowly challenge the shore as a new day dawns while enjoying a wonderful cup of coffee. This is living. Regardless that we are here as a result of the crash, this island is a true paradise. There is everything required to sustain life, water, food and cover. My mind is wandering then I hear Leeza leave the plane. She slowly walks towards me still naked, a true native of the islands.

"You should have wakened me. Is that coffee I smell?"

"Yes. There is a whole case plus canned milk. Would you like a cup? It sure hits the spot."

"Oh, yes. I have been drinking coffee for years. Daddy loves it."

Leeza sits beside me caressing her coffee cup. She is so appealing, my eyes sweep over her luscious body. The cool breeze of the ocean perks up her nipples. From this angle I can see her luv lips still puffy from last nights loving.

"I am sorry about last night Don. I fell asleep with you licking me. I was in wonderland and got lost. It looks like you need some relief."

My morning erection is overly obvious. Seeing Leeza naked and the memories of last night has me hurting for relief. Leeza moves beside me and caresses my spear.

"I love the feel of it, Don. Look, I am dripping again. Do you want to put it in me again? Can we fuck?"

"Oh, yes. It will be a great way to start the day. I will get a blanket."

With the blanket spread on a little sandy knoll I sit down. Leeza goes to her knees beside me. Again she is caressing my hurting cock. Her other hand is cupping my balls.

"Are they full? They feel so big."

"If my desire to make love to you is any indication, I would say they are over-filled."

Leeza lies on her back and spreads her legs. She is dripping a river of white cream. She is ready. I am ready.

"Leeza, this time you can be on top and control the action. It will feel much better."

On my back; Leeza positions herself above my cock. She lifts her body high enough to have me targeting her moist opening. Watching this young beauty is very erotic as she slowly lowers her self. Watching my white cock entering her dark body is fascinating. Slowly she engulfs my tool. She is so tight. Closing my eyes, I just enjoy the ride. This feeling is something you would love to last for ever. Leeza leans over and kisses both of my nipples. It feels funny, but sexy.

"Do you like that, Don?"

"Well, it is different. It doesn't feel that bad."

We had to stretch to kiss each other while coupled. I can still smell her shampoo, now mixed with the scent of animal sex. Slowly she raises her body and then plunges down. I can actually see my cock pushing out her tummy. Now that is sexy. The rhythm soon has her cumming. I desperately try to hold off, wanting to extend the feeling inside of her savoring every moment. Her tummy movements continue to mesmerize me. The shape of my cock is very noticeable. Then the urge; at this point nothing can stop the inevitable. Leeza is pushing down with me, and then pushing up as strings of hot cum surge upwards. It is like the air leaving a balloon as my high disintegrates. An aurora of bliss overtakes both of us. Leeza collapses against my chest, panting.

"Don, I wish we could do that forever. I can't tell you how good it feels when you shoot your hot cum in me. I can feel every surge. I don't want this end."

We stay cuddled until old faithful shrinks to a stub, slipping out of its moist warm home. Gently caressing Leeza's back down to her bum; this girl/woman has become a real lover. To think I was ready to strangle her two days ago. What a difference a day makes.

"Before we do anything else, we must take inventory of what we have; then we can spend the balance of today enjoying each other. We can take another trip to the pool. That moss area can be our love nest. But first, let's get cleaned up and have breakfast."

Following Leeza to the stream is a vision as cum and pussy juice run down her inner thighs, blobs of it. The creamy white is very distinguishable against her dark skin.

"You are leaking, Leeza."

"Don't get smart."

After a quick clean up we have something to eat. For the next three days we did nothing but eat and make love. My recuperative powers surprise even me. Yesterday, I actually came in Leeza six times. Not that I am complaining, but I didn't think I would ever be able to do that at my age. We have been here for eight days.

"Leeza, we must have been blown way off course. The searchers must be on the route to the island. We can only hope that they expand their search area, not that I haven't enjoyed my time with you."

"I know what you mean, Don. I was thinking the same thing. Usually, missing people are found in two or three days. I know my daddy won't quit. Is there anything that we can do?"

"Not really. The batteries are shot in the radio; the emergency beacon isn't doing anything. I checked it yesterday. Maybe I can take it out and see if it can be fixed."

Surprisingly, we are both calm accepting our situation. It helps that we enjoy each other. When I look at Leeza my thoughts keep switching from protector to lover. Both are good feelings. We have plenty of provisions and I have mastered the art of fishing. There is one area near a point of land going into the ocean where each cast brings in a fish. Some of the odd looking ones we throw back. We have found four different fruit trees giving us a good variety, but we still haven't found any sign of food animals. We actually haven't looked that hard considering the endless supply of fish and fruit.

Later that day I attempt to remove the signal beacon. It is bolted down and the wrenches I have aren't doing the job. The fasteners are stripped. I gently tap them with the hammer. To my surprise the signal light comes on and starts to flash.

"Leeza, the emergency beacon is sending a signal. I just whacked it with the hammer and it started to beep."

"What does that mean?"

"It sends a homing beacon to any search planes in a four hundred mile radius. We can't be four hundred miles from the home island. I am willing to bet that we will hear a plane engine in a day or two as they try to pinpoint the signal."

"That means we will be rescued."

"Yes. Don't you want to be rescued?"

"Yes and no. I don't want to do without you. Once we are back on the home island we won't be able to make love. Don, I do love you. I may be young, but I know how I feel."

"Leeza, I never thought I would feel like this about anyone again and especially someone as beautiful and young as you. You have no idea what you have done to my life."

"What will happen to us?"

"Well, we certainly won't be making love as often as we do now. I have to go back to the States, but I will be back. I don't want to lose you."

Leeza is in my arms. When I look into her eyes I see tears and kiss them away. We make love again like it will be the last time. Our climaxes are strong and exhausting. Later, while still in each other's arms, we discuss the possibilities.

"Leeza, I will make a point of coming down to the island at least once a month. I will keep in touch with you by phone and email. You will have to figure out how we can be together without arousing suspicion. Do you think you can convince your dad to let you come and visit me in the States?"

Her eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. She is imagining the possibilities.

"Oh, that would be wonderful, Don. I know I can get my dad to agree. He will be surprised to hear you invited me to visit. I will tell him we learned to get along while marooned on the island."

"You don't think your dad is that gullible? He is quite aware you are a beautiful young spoiled brat."

"Oh Don, you still don't think I am spoiled?"

"No, Leeza. I think you are the best thing that happened to me in years. Every time I think of us, I shock myself with the age difference."

"Age is all in your mind, it is just a number. You are young to me. I would love to visit you in the States. I haven't been anywhere but the islands."

"It is a wonderful place. You will enjoy it."

"Don, I will enjoy it because you are there."

We made sure that the pyre is ready for the first sound of an airplane engine. I cut some branches and soaked them in water to make sure we would be able to produce as much smoke as possible. The pressure of the thought of being rescued has the opposite effect on us. It tempers our ability to make physical love, but strengthens our bonding. It is a sort of catch twenty-two situation. At night we make love very tenderly; very slowly.

Knowing the beacon is pinging away actually makes us tense. When we thought rescue was remote we were calm, but now our nerves are on edge waiting to hear the drone of an engine. This morning is like the ones that have past. The sky is clear blue with few puffy white clouds. After breakfast we head for the pool. After leisurely swim we are on the moss joined at the hips.

"Do you think this will be the last time, Don?"

"I hope not. I love you and love loving you."

"Oh Don, I don't want to be rescued."

"Yes, you do. We will work something out."

It takes a while before we can accept the fact that we will be rescued shortly. After accepting it, it is easier. We take advantage of every opportunity to make love, which is every time Leeza sees I have a boner. I had no idea I could produce so much sperm. It must be our diet. We make love everywhere, at the pool mostly, but also on the beach if a boner develops when I am fishing. We are now counting every evening as a bonus since we sleep glued to each other.

The following day as we are finishing a fantastic climax we hear the drone of engines.

"Leeza, that is a plane engine, it is time to light the pyre."

With a quick kiss I pull on my shorts and head for the beach running. In the sky I can see the sunlight reflecting off the windows of the search plane. Lighting the pyre, the flames quickly ignite the wood. Leeza is running towards me with the soaked branches. Smoke billows upwards.

"Sorry Don, I had to clean myself up. It wouldn't do for our rescuers to see bubbles of cum dripping down my legs."

"No. But I love see it. I wonder when I will see it again."

The searchers have seen the smoke. The plane circles, rocks from side to side acknowledging us. It is not a seaplane, but we have been located. We watch as the plane swoops down and our eyes follow a streamer of cloth someone has thrown out the plane's window. It lands down the beach. We race for it. It is a can of coke wrapped in a towel; there is a note attached to it.

'Thank God you are alive and well. We have radioed your Dad that we located you. A sea plane will be here tomorrow to pick you up.'

We wave at the people in the plane. The plane dips it wings in acknowledgement and heads back the way it came. Leeza is in my arms.

"Oh Don, I love you so much. I don't want anything to change."

"I know, Leeza. I don't want to lose what we have. We have one more day and night. Let's make the most of it."

And we do. As soon as the plane is out of sight Leeza strips and is all over me. We walk hand in hand back to our pool, to our favorite spot on the moss and just hug. Feeling Leeza's young body close to me is so exhilarating. Shortly after we make love doggy style.

"Oh Don, it feels like you are in my stomach. Whatever it is that you are scratching don't stop."

I am in as deep as possible. Leeza's cheeks are spread exposing her beautiful puckered brown star. My finger softly caresses the tight rim as I pump. She is lost in her feelings then explodes in a climax. There is exhilaration as the strings of cum expel from me. From that point on we didn't stop to eat for the balance of the day. If we aren't coupled we are as one, arm in arm. We finally go to bed, knowing this will be the last time.

"Don, get up. Let's go to the pool. My dad will have the plane here as early as possible. I want you to love me one last time at our favorite place."

I will never admit this to anyone, but there are tears in my eyes. The romp at the pool will be the last time between Leeza's legs for an unknown time. Gently mounting her, moving slowly wanting to drag out the feelings we both enjoy for as long as possible. When we finally cum; it is a large load, deep in Leeza. We stay locked together until gravity dislodges my stub. Shortly after our romp, the seaplane appears in the distance. Leeza squeezes my arm, happy in the knowledge her pussy is already full of fresh cum.

"Leeza, we better get ready. We need to be dressed when your dad gets here."

We can hear the roar of an engine shortly after we return to the beach. We watch as the plane lands and taxis to shore. Before the plane stops Mr. Raven is in the water running towards his daughter. I can see the tears of joy in his eyes as his arms encircle the love of his life. I actually have a lump in my throat as well. Then he breaks his reunion.

"Don, we were surprised and shocked to hear the emergency beacon after nearly two weeks of searching. Thank you for taking care of Leeza."

He hugs me and goes back to Leeza.

Once loaded the plane taxis out into the waves; the surge of power of the engines has our bodies pushed into the seats as we move for the takeoff. Leeza, sitting beside me, her hand is in mine. I watch the tears flow down her face, desperately wanting to kiss them away but can't.

I wonder if this is the end of something wonderful, or the beginning of the love of my life. I hope it is the latter.
